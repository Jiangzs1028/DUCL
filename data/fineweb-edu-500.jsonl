{"text": "Eddie Foy, Sr.\n- For his son, see Eddie Foy, Jr.\nFoy's parents, Richard and Mary Fitzgerald, emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1855 and lived first in New York City's Bowery and then in Greenwich Village neighborhoods, where Eddie was born. Richard Fitzgerald died in an insane asylum in 1862 from syphilis-induced dementia, and his widow took her four children (Eddie was second oldest) to Chicago, where she reportedly at one time tended the mentally ill widow of Abraham Lincoln.\nSix-year-old Eddie began performing in the streets and local saloons to support his family. At 15, he changed his name to Foy and with a partner began dancing in bars, traveling throughout the western United States. He worked for a time as a supernumerary in theatrical productions, sharing a stage at times with such leading men of the time as Edwin Booth and Joseph Jefferson. With another partner, Jim Thompson, Foy went west again and gained his first professional recognition in mining camps and cow towns. In one such town, Dodge City, Kansas, Foy and his partner lingered for some time and Foy became acquainted with notable citizens Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Doc Holliday. In later years, Foy told of an altercation over a girl with fellow actor Charles Chaplin (not the later film star), who was drunkenly taking pot-shots at Foy. The gunfire awakened Wyatt Earp, who disarmed the actor and sent both the players home to sleep it off. Foy is also rumored to have been in Tombstone, Arizona, in October 1881, appearing at the Birdcage Theater when the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurred on the 26th of that month.\nIn 1879, Foy married Rose Howland, one of the singing Howland Sisters, who were traveling the same circuit. Three years later, Foy and troupe relocated to Philadelphia and joined the Carncross Minstrels. That same year, however, Rose Foy died in childbirth, as did the child she was delivering. Foy lingered with the troupe for two seasons and then returned to the road. He joined David Henderson's troupe and traveled all around the U.S., dancing, doing comedy, and acting in farces. In San Francisco, he met Lola Sefton and was romantically involved with her for ten years until her death in 1894. Although some sources claim they were married, no record of their marriage has ever been found, nor apparently did Foy ever state clearly that a marriage had occurred. They had no children.\nReturn to Chicago\nFoy returned to Chicago in 1888 as the star comedian in variety shows and revues, initially for his own company. He played the variety circuits for years in a series of song and dance acts, eventually rising to musical comedy stardom in such Broadway hits as The Strollers (1901) and Mr. Bluebeard (1903). Foy specialized in eccentric routines and costumes, often appearing in drag to hilarious effect. His upper lip extended well below his teeth, giving him an unusual V-shaped grin, and making him look like he had no upper teeth. As a result he spoke with a slurred lisp that audiences adored.\nIn 1896, Foy married his third wife, Madeline Morando, a dancer with his company. She gave him eleven children, of whom seven survived childhood: Bryan (1896–1977), who became a producer at Warner Bros; Charley (1898–1984), an actor; Mary (1901–1987); Madeline (1903–1988), an actress; Eddie Jr. (1905–1983), who carved out a successful career as an actor and entertainer on stage and screen, including a role in The Pajama Game and Bells Are Ringing; Richard (1905–1947); and Irving (1908–2003), a writer. Eddie Jr.'s son, Eddie III, was a casting director with Columbia Pictures for over 40 years.\nBetween 1901 and 1912, Foy Sr. played the leading comic roles in a series of musical comedies in New York City and on tour, including The Strollers (1901), The Wild Rose (1902), Mr. Bluebeard (1903), Piff! Paff! Pouf! (1904), The Earl and the Girl (1905), The Orchid (1907), Mr Hamlet of Broadway (1908/9), Up and Down Broadway (1910), and Over the River (1912). It was while on tour with Mr. Bluebeard that he became a hero of Chicago’s infamous Iroquois Theatre Fire, December 30, 1903. A malfunctioning spotlight set fire to the scenery backstage, and Foy stayed onstage until the last minute, trying to keep the audience from panicking. Unfortunately the theater’s safety features were woefully inadequate, the theater personnel untrained, and some of the exits locked from the outside, and at least 600 people perished. Foy escaped by crawling through a sewer.\nEddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys\nBetween 1910 and 1913, he formed a family vaudeville act, \"Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys\", which quickly became a national sensation. While Foy was a stern disciplinarian backstage – his wife Madeline died in 1918 – he portrayed an indulgent father onstage, and the Foys toured successfully for over a decade, appearing in one motion picture. The children began to go their separate ways after Eddie remarried to Marie Reilly Coombs in 1923, but four of the younger children (Madeline, Mary, Charley, and Irving) performed together until the mid 1930s. A dedicated trouper, the elder Foy continued to appear in vaudeville and starred in the hit Broadway comedy The Fallen Star in 1927. He died of a heart attack while headlining on the Orpheum circuit in Kansas City, Missouri, at age 71.\nThe seven reunited for a 1928 Vitaphone short #2580, \"Chips of (sic) the Old Block\". Six of the seven appeared onscreen, doing a portion of their song-and-dance act, while Bryan directed. The film opens with the girls singing and dancing \"Goodbye Blues\" while brother Bryan plays ukulele. Charley, Eddie Jr., and Irving then come on and perform a comedy routine. Next, Eddie Jr. does an eccentric dance routine, there's a short song interlude, and the film ends with soft shoe routine in which each has a solo bit.\nAfter the \"Seven Little Foys\" stopped performing together, the children pursued separate careers. Eddie Foy Jr. had a successful independent career as an actor, beginning with an appearance on Broadway as a single act in 1929. In the 1940s and 1950s, son Bryan composed show music, wrote for Buster Keaton, and had a long career as a director of films in Hollywood. Eddie Sr. and son Richard operated a theater chain business in Dallas. Son Irving also worked in the movie theater business, managing theaters in Dallas and Albuquerque. Son Charley and daughter Mary operated the Charley Foy Supper Club in Sherman Oaks, California, where comedians such as Jackie Gleason, Dan Rowan, Dick Martin, and Phil Silvers appeared early in their careers.\nThe family’s story was filmed in 1955 as The Seven Little Foys with Bob Hope as Eddie Sr. and James Cagney as George M. Cohan; Charley Foy narrated. Eddie Foy Jr. appeared as his father in several films – Frontier Marshal (1939), Lillian Russell (1940), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), and Wilson (1944) – as well as in a television version of The Seven Little Foys with Mickey Rooney (1964). The first stage musical version of The Seven Little Foys, written by Chip Deffaa, had its world premiere at the Seven Angels Theater in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2007. In 2008, it had its New York premiere as part of the New York International Fringe Festival; the cast included Ryan Foy, great grandson of Eddie Foy Sr. and grandson of Irving Foy.\n- \"Irving Foy, 94, Last of the Seven Little Foys\".

There are 6.3 million people in Texas without health insurance, which is about a quarter of the state's population, giving it the highest percentage of uninsured in the U.S. Gov. Rick Perry has said he won't expand Medicaid, despite heavy federal incentives, and the Republican-dominated state legislature turned down $76 billion in matching federal funds that would have helped expand coverage.\nIn Vermont, Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin and the legislature want a \"single-payer system that they say will give them the leverage to lower prices and provide better care for everyone in the state,\" Fox reports. But they don't yet have the votes to make this happen. This year's state election will decide in which direction health care moves.\nThe Affordable Care Act was designed to force state expansion of Medicaid to give healthcare to about 16 million more of the county's poorest people. But the Supreme Court decided in June that the law went too far on this, and ruled that states could opt out of expansion, losing all federal matching dollars that would have come with it. \"So now two of the biggest provisions of the law -- offering Medicaid to more people and setting up the health exchanges -- are in the hands of state officials,\" Fox reports, which makes this year's state elections vital in terms of healthcare.

{"text": "Energy is the capacity to work. Work is the transfer of energy. Energy can also be transformed. For example a plant can transform solar (radial) energy into chemical energy. Plant can then be burned in a stream generator and the energy transformed into the energy of motion that is the turning of the wheel. Energy has many forms: the heat from furnace, the sound of jet plane, the electric current that lights a bulb, the radioactivity in a heart pacemaker or the pull of magnet.\nForms of Energy:\nEnergy exists in two states, kinetic energy and potential. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion that is a thundering waterfall. Potential energy is stored energy like a gait boulder poised on a pinnacle. In a living animal, energy in chemical bonds is a form of potential energy. Animals use thin bond energy in organic molecules to accomplish biological work. Much of the work an animal performs, involves the transformation of potential energy to kinetic energy in its cells.\nUnits of Energy:\nEmployed unit for measuring heat in an animal is the kilocalorie (K cal :) or nutritional calorie (C). A kilocalorie is the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 kg: of water through 1°C and is equal to 1000 calories. A reasonable daily intake of energy for an average person is approximately 2000 to 2500 K.\nA calorie (C) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g (K. C) of water 1°C from 14.5 to 15.5°C. Cal.\nThe Laws of Energy Transformations:\nThere are two laws of thermodynamics that control energy transformations namely first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics.\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics:\nIt is also known as Law of energy Conservation. It states that ‘energy can neither be created nor destroyed but only transformed. Energy can change from one form to another form like electric energy passes through a hot plate to produce heat energy. It can be transformed from potential to kinetic energy as when a squirrel eats a nut and then uses this energy to climbs a tree, but it can never be lost or created. As the energy is neither created nor destroyed thus the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant.\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics:\nIt states that all objects in the universe tend to become more disordered and that the total measure of this degree of disorganization is called entropy. The natural gas burns in a stove, the potential chemical energy stored in bonds of the gas molecules is converted to light in the form of blue flame and heat. Some of heat energy can be used to boil water on the stove and some is dispersed into the kitchen, where it is no longer available to do work. This unusable energy represents increased entropy.\nActivation energy: Most chemical reactions require an input of energy to start a reaction is match is lit and the heat energy is used to start wood-burning in a fireplace. At the chemical level, the input energy must break existing chemical bonds before new bonds can form. In thermodynamics this input energy is called activation energy. It is reaction with net release of energy; the reactant contains more energy than the products. In other words, the amount of this excess energy (free energy) released into the environment is greater than the activation energy required to initiate the reaction. These reactions occur spontaneously and are called exergonic. In constant a chemical reaction in which the product contains more energy than the reactants require greater input of energy from the environment than is released. Because these reactions do not occur spontaneously, they are called endergonic. The amount of reactant substance converted to product substance in a given period of time is the reaction rate. The reaction rate of exergonic reaction does not depend on how much energy the reaction releases but on the amount of activation energy required for the reaction to begin. The larger the activation energy of chemical reaction, the more slowly the reaction occurs, because at a given temperature, fewer molecules succeed in overcoming the initial energy hurdle. Activation energies are not fixed. For example when certain chemical bonds are stressed, they may break more easily."}

{"text": "» Enjoy our Liturgical Seasons series of e-books!\nOld Calendar: St. Hermenegild, martyr\nSt. Martin was born in Todi, Italy. He was elected pope in 649 during the period of the last christological controversy. For his defense of Christ as true God and true man, he was exiled by the Byzantine emperor Constans II to Crimea where he died, broken by his sufferings.\nAccording to the 1962 Missal of St. John XXIII the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, today is the feast of St. Hermenegild, son of the king of the Visigoths in Spain, who married the daughter of the king of the Franks. Despite the opposition of his father, who was an Arian, he was converted to Catholicism. He was imprisoned and then was put to death. The feast of St. Martin I is celebrated on November 12.\nSt. Martin I\nThe unfortunate victim of Constans' wrath was the virtuous Martin. Born in Todi of noble birth, he had served as nuncio to Constantinople under Pope Theodore, gaining experience in dealing with the Byzantine court and familiarizing himself with the Monothelite teachings so prevalent in the East. Without waiting for the necessary imperial mandate, Martin proceeded with his consecration on July 5, 649. This independent act so enraged the emperor that he refused to acknowledge Martin as the legitimate pope.\nA staunch defender of the orthodox, Martin immediately convened a synod in the Lateran. Attended by 105 Western bishops, the synod studied all aspects of Monothelitism and the emperor's Type. After nearly a month, the synod reached a conclusion. They determined that there were two wills in Christ, condemned the One Will heresy, and further condemned Constans' Type\nfor boldly prohibiting the truthful teachings of the apostles. In an effort to pacify the emperor, Martin acknowledged Constans' good intentions in trying to unify the Church and placed the burden of responsibility on the poor advice of Constantinople's patriarchs.\nConstans, far from appeased, was determined that his religious policies would not be ignored. Appointing his chamberlain Olympius as exarch to Italy, he dispatched him with the order to obtain the signatures of acceptance from all Italians without exception. Olympius proved to be a dismal failure, both in his mission and in an attempted assassination of the popular pope. The exarch prudently abandoned his post and fled to Sicily to fight the invading Muslims.\nIn the summer of 653, the furious emperor appointed yet another exarch, Theodore Calliopas, with orders to escort the inflexible pontiff to Constantinople. Calliopas and his officers boldly entered the Lateran, arrested the bedridden Martin, and presented the clergy with Constans' edict deposing the pope who had been consecrated illegally. The voyage, which took nearly three months, subjected the sickly pope to humiliation and abuse. Arriving in Constantinople, racked with dysentery and disabled by gout, Martin was placed in solitary confinement. On December 19, 653, Martin was brought to trial on trumped-up charges of treason and sacrilege. The pope, near death and realizing his position futile, could only laugh at the ridiculous accusations and beg the emperor to excuse the fumbling witnesses before they added perjury to false witness! Constans pronounced the predetermined verdict of guilty on the pontiff and sentenced him to public flogging and death. The disapproving crowd watched, horrified; and it was only by the dying Patriarch Paul's intercession that Martin's sentence of public execution was commuted to banishment.\nFor nearly three months, the pope suffered under the worst conditions in a Byzantine prison before he was exiled to the Crimea. There, on September 16, 655, suffering from cold and starvation, Pope Martin gratefully met his God. Pious Martin had been disgraced in life but later became honored as a martyr. Today he is venerated as a saint; his feast is celebrated by both the Roman and Greek Churches on April 13. — The Popes: A Papal History\n, J.V. BartlettSymbols:\nPope holding money; Pope with geese around him (possible confusion by artist with Martin of Tours); Pope in a prison cell.Things to Do:\n- Read another biography of St. Martin I.\n- As head of the Church, St. Martin condemned false doctrine and thereby brought upon himself the wrath of the Emperor. He would not yield a hairbreadth from the way of truth, even when such a stand entailed suffering, imprisonment, exile, death. Here is a model for fidelity to one's vocation. In every state of life there are opportunities for martyrdom. Spend some time considering your own life and examine whether or not you take the opportunities presented to witness to the truth.\n- Pope Martin, fearing that the truth about Christ would not be taught, called a council at the Lateran. Learn more about monothelitism and monothelites.\nLeovigild, Arian King of the Visigoths, had two sons, Hermenegild and Recared, who were reigning conjointly with him. All were Arians, but Hermenegild married a zealous Catholic, the daughter of Sigebert, King of France, and by her holy example was converted to the faith. His father, on hearing the news, denounced him as a traitor, and marched to seize his person. Hermenegild tried to rally the Catholics of Spain in his defense, but they were too weak to make any stand; and after a two years’ fruitless struggle, Hermenegild surrendered on the assurance of a free pardon. Once he was safely in the royal camp, the king had him loaded with fetters and cast into a foul dungeon at Seville.\nTortures and bribes were in turn employed to shake his faith, but Hermenegild wrote to his father that he regarded the crown as nothing, and preferred to lose scepter and life rather than betray the truth of God. At length, on Easter night, an Arian bishop entered his cell, and promised him his father’s pardon if he would receive Communion from his hands. Hermenegild indignantly rejected the offer, and knelt with joy for his death-stroke, praying for his persecutors. The same night a light streaming from his cell told the Christians keeping vigil nearby that the martyr had won his crown and was celebrating the Resurrection of the Lord with the Saints in glory.\nKing Leovigild, on his death-bed, was changed interiorly. He had been witness to the miracles that had occurred after his son’s cruel death, and he told his son and successor Recared to seek out Saint Leander, whom he himself had persecuted. Recared should follow Hermenegild’s example, said the king, and be received by the bishop into the Church. Recared did so; and although his father himself had not had the courage to renounce the false faith publicly, after his father’s death the new king labored so earnestly for the extirpation of Arianism that he brought over the whole nation of the Visigoths to the Church. “Nor is it to be wondered,” says Saint Gregory, “that he came thus to be a preacher of the true faith, since he was the brother of a martyr, whose merits helped him to bring so many into the haven of God’s Church.” — Little Pictorial Lives of the SaintsPatron:\nYoung prince in armour being borne to heaven while contemplating the crucifix while around him angels carry an axe; chains; royal regalia; a palm; and a rose wreath and heretical bishops and king stand below him; prince with an axe.Things to Do:\nSaturday of the 5th Week of Lent\nStation at St. John before the Latin Gate (San Giovanni a Porta Latina):\nToday's Station takes place in the Church of St. John before the Latin Gate.

{"text": "Artistic practices are ways that human beings try to make sense of the world, of nature and of what we do and say with one another. So, in order to understand something about artistic practices, we will have to think about how such practices differ from other ways that human beings make sense of their world – such as religion, education, science or philosophy. And in thinking about what makes artistic practices distinctive, we will of course have to think not only about what such practices ‘mean’ but also about how their meaning is related to their material conditions – stone, paint, sound, film, the human body or the printed word; and to what effect human beings have transformed these conditions in ‘artistic’ ways through socially and historically specific forms of painting, dance, music, poetry, drama, photography and film. All of which is to say: We will be asking not only what art is (or, what the ‘arts’ are), but also why we care about art, if we still do? We will discuss texts by Plato, Schiller, Hegel, Nietzsche, Lukács, Benjamin, Adorno, Merleau-Ponty, Bazin, and others; and too we will look at specific plays (Antigone) and movies (Fight Club) and paintings (Picasso's, for example) and poems to help make are conversations more concrete.\nStudents must register for both the lecture and discussion section of this course.\nCourse Open to: Degree Students\nOpen to Undergraduate students."}
{"text": "Recyle Trees and Greens\nPick from several methods, but put those decorations to use outdoors after the holidays. Coastal erosion and wildlife habitat projects offer dropoff points, and municipalities may chip them into mulch. Strip off the ribbons, add apples covered in peanut butter, and hang that wreath outside for the birds.\nAvoid Citrus Troubles\nLemon, satsuma, and other citrus trees in pots make great sunroom plants in winter. Avoid trouble by keeping an eye out for common pests like sticky, white mealybugs, pinhead-sized aphids, and hard round scales. Use alcohol or insecticidal soap plus physical controls, and prune off damaged stems.\nClean Perennial Beds\nClean up the perennial bed and get ready for spring. Cut down lantana, buddleia, and cannas that have browned, cut up the leaves and stems and compost them with one mowing's worth of ryegrass from the lawn. Check mulch: no more than 2 inches up close, and none directly on the crown.\nPrepare for Tree Planting\nAny day you can dig the soil without it sticking to the shovel is a fine day to plant a tree. Water trees well the day before planting, dig a hole wider and slightly deeper than the rootball. Mix the native soil with one-quarter by volume organic matter to improve it. Water and mulch after planting.\nSharpen Those Shears\nTake time now to get pruners, shears, and saws ready. Sharp blades make clean cuts, but most important, sharper is safer. Use a small file and stroke away from you and with the edge on the tool. With sewing machine or light vegetable oil, lubricate the tool and wipe dry with a rag."}
{"text": "Christian Horneman (15 August 1765 – 7 March 1844) was a Danish miniature and pastels painter, mainly known for portraits. He was the father of the composer Emil Horneman and grandfather of C. F. E. Horneman, also a composer.\nHorneman was born on 15 August 1765 in Copenhagen. He attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1780, winning its small silver medal in 1785, and its large silver medal in 1786. In 1787 he went abroad to further his studies and it would take sixteen years before he returned to Denmark. He specialized in portrait miniatures. He experienced the outbreak of the French Revolution first hand in Paris in 1789. He also visited Italy and Vienna, where Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein and Heinrich Füger were among the artists who inspired him. In Berlin he learned a new technique, most likely from Daniel Chodowiecki, which he often used in his later work.\nOm 1803 Horneman returned to Denmark and the following year he was appointed miniature painter to the Royal Danish County. In 1805 he became a member of the Academy and in 1816 he was given free residency at Charlottenborg. He was made a professor in 1835.\nIn his later years he suffered from poor health and from 1840 he received an annual pension. He is buried at the Garnisons Cemetery in Copenhagen.\nWhile abroad he had the opportunity to make portraits of a few of the leading figures of his day, including Ludwig van Beethoven (1802) and Joseph Haydn, while he made sketches of several others in a sketch book now kept at the Danish National Gallery. The portrait of Beethoven was painted in 1803 as a miniature. Beethoven was very fond of the result, possibly because he is very good looking in it compared to later representations, and sent it to Stephan von Breuning (de), a school friend, in the hopes of reconciliation one year after the portrait was completed.\nAfter his return to Denmark he was one among several portrait painters who filled the void after the death of Cornelius Høyer and Jens Juel. He made miniatures and particularly pastels which was the technique in which he did his best works. In the 1820s he also turned to lithography.\n- Media related to Christian Horneman at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"text": "Those of you that read our series of international mobile data analyses know that Finland is the country with the highest average mobile data consumption in the world.\nTruly unlimited mobile data is a key explanation to this: 66% of Finland’s mobile subscriptions (excl. M2M) had unlimited mobile data in June. As a direct consequence of this Finns have developed a readiness to try out new apps and services at any location and at any time – as they never have to consider the data consumption or the associated cost. The habit of ‘Wi-Fi hunting’ is not spread in Finland.\nBecause of the unlimited model, mobile has also come to substitute fixed in many households. The average Finn had 1,72 mobile subscriptions in December 2017 – much more than the Nordic neighbours:\n- Finland 1,72\n- Denmark 1,44\n- Sweden 1,41\n- Norway 1,16\nBut even if its worry-free with an unlimited mobile data subscription it’s not necessary cheap.\nThe Finnish subscriptions are typically charged on speed. But even with the absolutely slowest speed tier (256 kbit/s) and no voice included, it’s 7 EUR per month. Every month. For cases with high usage – like smartphones or home internet – the regular Finnish subscriptions are without a doubt providing good value for money (see Figure 14 here), but how willing would anybody be to spend 7 EUR or more every single month on a subscription for cases with low or rare usage like a secondary phone, a connected laptop, the fishing hut in Lapland, a dog tracker or a wearable gadget?\nSince the Finnish smartphone penetration has levelled out at around 80% and 60% of addressable customers already pay for 4G speed tiers, the monetisation upside isn’t as obvious any longer for the three Finnish MNOs Elisa, Telia and DNA. The Finnish operators, especially DNA, have otherwise spoiled us with unparalleled mobile service revenue growth in 2017 and 2018.\nAn MVNO, Moi, has had success in the Finnish market with a model not based on the ‘one size fits all’ which totally dominates the offers among the MNOs. Their basic why-pay-for-something-you-don’t-use message appears to have resonated well with pockets of the Finnish market. Moi has recently expanded into the business market as well.\nEven if Moi’s market share – according to official statistics – wasn’t more than 1% in June, it’s natural that one of the MNOs would react. Telia is generally not perceived as the MNO that brings useful innovation to the Finnish market – some Finns are still suspicious of Telia ever since the company (then called Sonera) introduced shared bucket plans as a replacement to unlimited in 2013. It didn’t play out well and even if Telia stopped it, Elisa’s marketing is still after all these years hammering in the message that Elisa is synonymous with unlimited.\nWith this perception in mind, it’s interesting that it’s Telia that makes a serious attempt to innovate in the name of customer friendliness.\nIt’s an all-digital proposition which addresses each an every connectivity need one might have in mobile. But it’s not a ‘one size fits all’ proposition, it’s a proposition that resizes to usage levels and usage patterns. We think Dot gives an indication of where our industry needs to move next – keywords being flexibility, adaptability, app-based sales & upsell.\nPay when you use it\nWhen the smartphone and home internet market is fully penetrated, market growth can only be sustained by entering new segments. As discussed, unlimited month-by-month contracts typically don’t suit the usage profile or usage habits of auxiliary, secondary, connections very well. And even though Finland has the highest average usage in the world, the median usage is much lower so there are plenty of primary connections that could be addressed as well.\nOne of the key characteristics of Telia Dot is that you pay when the subscription is used – but not when it isn’t. Unlike a month-by-month plan for e.g. a dog tracker that would cost 7 EUR per month even though the dog owner might only use the tracker for a few weekends during a year, the Telia Dot subscription in the tracker would only cost those days when it’s on the network (heads up for fine print; read on).\nThe exact pricing of Telia Dot is actually quite complicated. Telia doesn’t want you to look into it; it’s well hidden. They instead want you to remember two things:\n- When the subscription isn’t used, it’s not charged\n- When it is used, it’s never more than 1 EUR per day\nIf we go a bit deeper, the first usage of any kind – voice, text, data – per day will be charged 0,2 EUR. So when you have started to use it, the charge is never going to be less than 0,2 EUR per day.\nFurther voice, texts and data are then charged on top according to actual usage in a quite complicated way where the unit price per minute, text or GB goes down. The table below shows how the unit price per GB develops with the spend per day.\nWith lower usage, you pay more per unit – with higher usage less per unit. This is true also for voice and messaging. But it stops when you reach 1 EUR, then you pay 1 EUR regardless of how high the usage is that day.\nInternational calls and premium numbers are of course not included; that’s not controversial. But this wouldn’t be a telco proposition without some fine print, and here it is: Unless a subscription has generated 15 EUR of revenue during three months, Telia ‘has the right’ to charge 5 EUR per month.\nIn other words: Telia Dot will never cost less than 5 EUR per month. This makes quite a few very low usage cases less attractive – like our dog tracker case – but leaves space for medium-usage cases that aren’t very well served by the current unlimited subscriptions.\nAlways up to 100 Mbit/s and always with EU roaming\nEven with a minimum price of 5 EUR per month, Telia Dot brings some benefits compared to the throttled cheapest plans currently in Finland – the most obvious being that it always supports a speed up to 100 Mbit/s. A regular smartphone subscription with that speed would trade at around 25 EUR per month online.\nAnother benefit compared to the cheapest, throttled, plans is that Telia Dot includes EU roaming. It’s actually better than that – in a typical Telia fashion, you can use your unlimited data not just in Finland, but in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia – where Telia Company produces it inhouse. You might end up paying 1 EUR per day for unlimited data, but it is truly unlimited. In the rest of the EU, up to 0,36 GB per day is included.\nTelia Dot is also non-binding – one month at a time. Just like any digital subscription is outside of telco.\nWhen does it pay off then?\nSo if it’s easy to know how little you will pay with Telia Dot (5 EUR per month) and easy to know how much you might pay with Telia Dot (31 EUR per month in a 31 day month with max usage every day) – how much will you actually pay?\nHere’s where Telia Dot starts to be clever and digital. Before signing up for the service, the Telia Dot app will – based on the actual usage recorded by the phone – calculate what your usage would have costed you in the past month. You would of course need to give your consent to do these calculations, but it’s an smart way to use the information in the phone. It also allows Telia to make the calculation also for potential customers currently with Elisa, DNA or Moi.\nIn true Netflix-style, Telia is giving the first 30 days for free.\nBut we of course needed to calculate how much mobile data a Telia Dot user would have to generate to reach the maximum 1 EUR day fee. That works out to be 0,47 GB. So if you use 0,47 GB or more every day, you will end up paying 28-31 EUR per month for Telia Dot. This is a bit more than the market price for a regular subscription with the same speed and with inclusive EU roaming. If you also use voice and messaging, you will reach that 1 EUR per day threshold quicker.\n0,47 GB per day corresponds to around 14 GB per month. Since the average usage per non-M2M SIM in Finland was 16 GB per month in the first half of 2018, it suggests that Telia Dot will be interesting for many Finnish mobile subscribers, but not for all.\nIt thus seems as if Telia hasn’t invented Dot to disrupt the Finnish market using price. It rather seems as if Telia has looked at the slogan of Google’s Project Fi:\nGet unlimited data when you need it, and savings when you don’t.\nNo regular bill – credit card only\nTelia Dot will – just like Spotify and Netflix – charge the subscriber’s credit card monthly for usage. Telia has apparently decided that the billing relationship that telcos typically hail isn’t worthwhile.\nTelia hails the app instead. That’s where you see your usage and that’s where you track your costs.\nBuy at any time – in the app\nThe app is also where you become a customer of Telia Dot. And it’s the place where you expand your number of Telia Dot subscriptions – to yourself or to your family.\nDone right, it’s upsell at its best: In-app digital purchases without the need to visit a Telia store, a dealer, open some web form or talk to a call centre. It’s scalable, transparent, quick to modify and commission-free.\nDigital wellbeing controls – in the app\nThe Telia Dot app is also having tools for digital wellbeing. The fact that practically nobody has any limitations on their mobile data usage in Finland means that there is a lively debate on what this means for e.g. teenagers – but also for small children when their parents risk not giving them sufficient recognition while staring at their screens.\nFunctionalities to monitor and set rules for mobile data usage are built into the Telia Dot app. The app is also said to be a catalyst for qualitative discussions around mobile usage in families.\nWe don’t believe in coincidence. The same Telia yesterday published survey results showing that 83% of Finnish parents in families with children feel that they spend too much time on their phones (the parents seem to be a bit worried about their own habits as well). Of course this release was a prop for Telia Dot.\nTelia can now combine sales, self-service and tools for management of digital wellbeing in one and the same Telia Dot app. It feels very 2018 and should be good for upsell and customer retention.\nWhy should I care?\nThere’s nothing wrong with the performance of any of the Finnish operators. They were all delivering record results in Q3; EBITDA margins have never been higher, so it’s definitely not an unhealthy market Telia is trying to nudge.\nWith a generally high customer satisfaction brought by reasonably priced unlimited data plans and excellent networks, it will be interesting to follow what commercial impact Telia Dot will make. The biggest question mark, if you ask us, is if potential customers will understand the pricing. Or trust Telia enough not to care.\nHere’s why you should care: We think Dot is one of the better examples so far of ‘telco goes digital‘. A one stop shop for mobile connectivity with a high level of flexibility and adaptability, supporting basically all mid and high-usage use cases in the consumer space. It should fit in an eSIM future. We suggest the industry takes notice, copies, flavours and improves details – like transparency – where seen necessary."}

{"text": "|William Duer and the Crash of 1792\nThere once was a man named William Duer. Born in England in 1743, Duer was the son of a very successful West Indian planter. Educated at Eton, Duer settled in America in 1773, became sympathetic with the colonists grievances against Britain and, at the same time, he quickly began to hold positions of importance in New York society. Duer regaled his friends and associates at dinner at his home on Broadway, not far from Wall Street, where Trinity Church is still located. At his wedding to Catherine Alexander (\"Lady Kitty\"), the bride was given away by George Washington.\nDuer became a member of the Continental Congress, a New York judge, and a signer of the Articles of Confederation. He was also secretary to the Board of the Treasury (appointed by Alexander Hamilton), a position that made him privy to the inner workings of American finance in the late 1780s. Hamilton, our first Treasury Secretary, was honest and never profited from his government position. Duer, on the other hand, saw nothing wrong with using information he was privy to to try and make a fast buck.\nThe Duer/Hamilton relationship was to have its trying moments. Duer had been instrumental in helping Hamilton establish the Bank of New York. Hamilton would attempt to bail Duer out of some major problems, later.\nDuer had made his fortune in land and speculating on the Revolutionary debt. In 1791, Duer resigned his Treasury position and entered into a partnership with Alexander Macomb, one of New York's richest and most prominent citizens. They agreed to combine Macomb's money and Duer's speculative talents and insider connections with the Treasury Department. Duer began speculating on Bank of New York stock when there were rumors that it was to be bought by the Bank of the U.S. If true, the stock was sure to rise. But while long in the market with Macomb, he was short (betting the stock would go down) Bank of New York in his own account. If the merger failed, Duer and Macomb would lose, but Duer, on his own, would make a fortune. Since his agreement with Macomb called for using Macomb's money, not his own, all Duer had to lose by double-crossing his partner was honor, a sacrifice he seemed perfectly willing to make.\nHamilton, unaware of Duer's duplicity, but appalled at his speculative activities wrote on March 2, 1792. \"'Tis time, there must be a line of separation between honest Men & knaves, between respectable Stockholders and dealers in the funds, and mere unprincipled Gamblers.\"\nDuer became the center of attention and many were only too anxious to lend him money in hopes of getting in on the bandwagon. He began to buy other bank stocks for future delivery, betting that rising prices would enable him to pay for them when the time came.\nBut at the same time there were others who had an interest in seeing that prices fell, namely the Livingston clan, one of the richest families in the New York area. To ensure this, they began to withdraw gold and silver from their bank deposits, contracting the local money supply and forcing banks to call in loans, thus instituting a credit squeeze. Interest rates soared to as much as one percent a day.\nThis was ruinous for Duer and others who had borrowed to speculate. Desperate, he tried to borrow more to cover his obligations (All-Tech and Momentum Securities weren't around then to help him out), but there was none to be had.\nWith his fall, panic ensued. Immediately, Duer was thrown in debtors prison and Macomb ended up there as well. Alexander Hamilton, however, rode to the rescue and ensured that the country as a whole didn't suffer. He ordered the Treasury to purchase several hundred thousand dollars worth of federal securities to support the market, and he urged banks not to call in loans. Soon, calm quickly returned. According to historian John Steele Gordon, \"It would be 195 years, until the great crash of 1987, before the federal government once again moved decisively to prevent a panic.\"\nBecause Duer often traded on insider information, he earned the distinction of being the first to do so. Within a month of his collapse and the crash that followed, the auctioneers and dealers resolved to move themselves in from the street and the coffeehouses and to find a more permanent location. It became apparent that the marketplace needed a central location so that dealings could be better controlled and better records kept. In May 1792, dealers and auctioneers entered the Buttonwood Agreement. Meeting under a buttonwood tree, today the location of 68 Wall Street, the traders agreed to establish a formal exchange for the buying and selling of shares and loans (bonds).\nAnd what became of Duer? Hamilton tried to intervene on his behalf but was only able to obtain a short reprieve. Duer soon ended up back in prison and he died there in 1799.\n\"Wall Street: A History,\" by Charles Geisst\n\"The Great Crash of 1792,\" an article in the May/June issue of American Heritage magazine, written by John Steele Gordon]\""}

He continued in politics, winning election to the Maine Senate in 1982. Baldacci served as a State Senator for 12 years. In 1994, following the retirement of his cousin, United States Senator George J. Mitchell, Baldacci won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine's Second District, replacing Senator (then Representative) Olympia Snowe, who had moved on to Mitchell's open Senate seat. He was reelected to Congress in the elections of 1996, 1998, and 2000, serving on the House Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\nElection as Governor\nA Democrat, Baldacci was first elected in 2002, defeating Republican candidate Peter Cianchette, who garnered 41% of the vote, and Green Party nominee Jonathan Carter, who won 9%. Baldacci was sworn in as Maine's Governor on January 8, 2003. In 2006, Baldacci won re-election from a field of 4 major candidates. As Governor, he is a member of the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association.\nAfter being elected, Baldacci attempted to fill a $1.2 billion deficit. This was done through budget cuts and fee increases. Baldacci refused to raise broad based taxes, honoring a campaign pledge.\nBaldacci also established a controversial state funded health care program known as Dirigo Health. The program offers subsidized health care to individuals and Maine businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Individuals in the system enjoy unlimited preventive care. The program is funded by taxes levied on health insurance companies. This tax is controversial, with critics claiming that it raises health care costs and drives insurers out of the state. Proponents claim that the preventive care eventually lowers health care costs. Thus far, Dirigo not been widely successful and has endured political and public setbacks. The Baldacci administration maintains the program can be fixed if more taxpayer money is invested into it. Regardless of the future of Dirigo, its reputation will remain contentious.\nIn 2005, Baldacci introduced legislation to expand Maine's civil rights law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. This legislation in Maine had been defeated via referendum by voters two times before. The law passed, but opponents of the law initiated a referendum to overturn the law. Voters upheld the new law.\nBaldacci is a supporter of regionalization, a sometimes contentious policy of merging local-government services to save money on administrative costs. While Baldacci has had some success with regionalizing local government, it has often come under fire from rural lawmakers who view the process as weakening their communities.\nDemocratic-leaning voters had a wide array of choices. Merrill (who was elected to her state house seat as a Democrat), Woodcock, and LaMarche received money from Maine's Clean Elections law. Merrill and LaMarche were generally seen as taking votes from Baldacci, while Woodcock's socially conservative position prompted many longtime Republicans to throw their votes to Baldacci, Merrill, or LaMarche.\nBaldacci won the election with 38% of the vote. Woodcock placed second with 30%. Merrill received a surprising 21%, narrowly defeating Baldacci among unenrolled voters. LaMarche finished with 10%, enough to maintain ballot access for the Green Party.\nGovernor Baldacci was inaugurated on January 3, 2007 in Augusta, Maine. During his inaugural speech, Baldacci reaffirmed his controversial goal to combine Maine's 152 school districts into only 26.\nShortly after beginning his second term, he proposed consolidating Maine's 152 school districts into 26. Many Maine teachers and administrators oppose the move. Baldacci claims that the proposal will reduce bureaucratic redundancy and make more money available for classrooms. Critics contend it reduces local control. Debate over the proposal continues, with the Legislature inititally appearing to favor a compromise proposal that would reduce the number of districts, but not as radically as proposed by Baldacci, and with exceptions for island schools.\nBaldacci has also proposed a controversial cigarette tax of an additional $1.50 per pack, which would bring Maine's tax to the highest cigarette tax in the nation at $3.50 in tax per pack.\nHis current term will end in January of 2011.\nBorn in Bangor, Maine, he grew up with seven siblings, in a Lebanese-Italian family. As a youngster, he worked in the family business, Momma Baldacci's restaurant in Bangor. A graduate of Bangor High School, he received a B. S. degree in history from the University of Maine at Orono. Following his father's example, a Bangor City Councilor, he entered public service as the youngest member of that Council at the age of 23 in 1978.\nHe is a Roman Catholic. He lives with his wife Karen and son Jack in the Blaine House in Augusta, Maine. Baldacci is first cousin to former United States Senate majority leader George J. Mitchell and to famed author David Baldacci.

{"text": "eso0606 — Science Release\nThe Invisible Galaxies That Could Not Hide\nMetal-Rich Distant Galaxy Found With ESO's VLT\n15 February 2006\nAstronomers, using the unique capabilities offered by the high-resolution spectrograph UVES on ESO's Very Large Telescope, have found a metal-rich hydrogen cloud in the distant universe. The result may help to solve the missing metal problem and provides insight on how galaxies form.\n\"Our discovery shows that significant quantities of metals are to be found in very remote galaxies that are too faint to be directly seen\", said Céline Péroux (ESO), lead-author of the paper presenting the results .\nThe astronomers studied the light emitted by a quasar located 9 billion light-years away that is partially absorbed by an otherwise invisible galaxy sitting 6.3 billion light-years away along the line of sight.\nThe analysis of the spectrum shows that this galaxy has four times more metals than the Sun. This is the first time one finds such a large amount of 'metals'  in a very distant object. The observations also indicate that the galaxy must be very dusty.\nAlmost all of the elements present in the Universe were formed in stars, which themselves are members of galaxies. By estimating how many stars formed over the history of the Universe, it is possible to estimate how much metals should have been produced. This apparently straightforward reasoning has however since several years been confronted with an apparent contradiction: adding up the amount of metals observable today in distant astronomical objects falls short of the predicted value. When the contribution of galaxies now observed at cosmological distances is added to that of the intergalactic medium, the total amounts for no more than a tenth of the metals expected.\nStudying distant galaxies is however a difficult task. The further a galaxy, the fainter it is, and the small or intrinsically faint ones won't be observed. This may introduce severe biases in the observations as only the largest and most active galaxies are picked up.\nAstronomers therefore came up with other ways to study distant galaxies: they use quasars, most probably the brightest distant objects known, as beacons in the Universe.\nInterstellar clouds of gas in galaxies, located between the quasars and us on the same line of sight, absorb parts of the light emitted by the quasars. The resulting spectrum consequently presents dark 'valleys' that can be attributed to well-known elements. Thus, astronomers can measure the amount of metals present in these galaxies - that are in effect invisible - at various epochs.\n\"This can best be done by high-resolution spectrographs on the largest telescopes, such as the Ultra-violet and Visible Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on ESO's Kueyen 8.2-m telescope at the Paranal Observatory,\" declared Péroux.\nHer team studied in detail the spectrum of the quasar SDSS J1323-0021 that shows clear indications of absorption by a cloud of hydrogen and metals located between the quasar and us. From a careful analysis of the spectrum, the astronomers found this 'system' to be four times richer in zinc than the Sun. Other metals such as iron appear to have condensed into dust grains.\n\"If a large number of such 'invisible' galaxies with high metal content were to be discovered, they might well alleviate considerably the missing metals problem\", said Péroux.\nHigh resolution images and their captions are available on this page.\n The discovery is to appear in a paper published by Astronomy and Astrophysics (\"The Most Metal-Rich Intervening Quasar Absorber Known\", by C. Péroux et al.) and available in PDF format.

{"text": "|No.3 May 2007|\n|Crop Prospects and Food Situation|\nUnfavourable prospects for 2007 wheat crop, sharply reduced harvest in Morocco\nHarvesting of the 2007 winter cereal crops is due to start from June in most countries of North Africa. Although precipitation improved in April, the outlook for the subregion’s aggregate wheat and barley crops is poor due to insufficient soil moisture at planting and subsequent erratic rains in several growing areas. In Morocco, the most affected country, wheat production is forecast to drop by over 50 percent, to the lowest level of the past five years. In Algeria and Tunisia, reductions in area planted and yields due to inadequate rains during the season are expected to result in lower crops compared to last year. In Egypt by contrast, the outlook is favourable, mainly for the irrigated wheat crop, although production is forecast lower than last year’s bumper crop. Overall, FAO forecasts the subregion’s aggregate wheat output at 14.5 million tonnes, 22 percent down from the good crop of 2006 and below average. Production of barley is put at 3.2 million tonnes, a decrease of over 28 percent.\nOverall food supply situation remains satisfactory but localized food difficulties persist in several countries\nIn western Africa, rains started in March in the southern parts of the coastal countries, allowing sowing of the first 2007 maize crops due for harvest from July. Planting of coarse grains will progress northwards in these countries following the onset of the rains. By contrast, seasonably dry conditions prevail in the Sahelian zone where bumper crops were harvested last year. Following the release of the final production figures, the 2006 aggregate cereal production in the nine Sahelian countries was estimated at a record 15.1 million tonnes, slightly higher than the previous year’s crop and 19 percent above the average of the previous five years.\nReflecting two consecutive bumper harvests, markets are well supplied and cereal prices continue to follow the normal trend in most countries. However, localized food security problems persist in several areas due mostly to lack of access or civil strife. In Chad, the worrying security situation in the eastern part of the country is disrupting marketing activities, limiting the flow of commodities between regions and leading to food price spikes in some areas. The continuing population displacement may also affect land preparation for the 2007 cropping season due to start in May. In Mauritania, Niger and Burkina Faso localized populations, already suffering the effects of reduced production in recent years, have yet again had poor harvests because of adverse weather, and their food security situation remain precarious. Food insecurity is also reported in parts of Guinea-Bissau due to marketing disruptions. In Senegal, where insufficient rainfall and inadequate supply of inputs resulted in a 33 percent drop in cereal production compared to the previous year, low supply and increasing prices of millet and sorghum continue to be reported in most regions. However, in areas with high consumer population such as Dakar, Saint-Louis, Thiès and Kaolack, higher purchasing power and effective demand have meant that markets are better supplied both with domestic production and imports. It has been reported that the millet price has dropped by 10 percent in March in Saint-Louis. Since prices are increasing more rapidly in rural areas, vulnerable groups in areas that have experienced sharp declines in production, or were affected by other shocks, need to be continuously monitored and assisted as necessary. Emergency food assistance continues to be also needed in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone for large numbers of IDPs and refugees as a result of civil conflicts.\nFood insecurity persists due to civil strife\nSatellite imagery indicates that the rainy season started on time in the south, allowing land preparation and sowing of the first 2007 maize crop, due for harvest from July. Planting of coarse grains will progress northwards following the onset of the rains. In Central African Republic, persistent insecurity continues to hamper farming activities and large-scale population movements both within the country and to neighbouring countries are reported, notably in the north. Nearly 200 000 people are in need of urgent food assistance according to WFP.\nEarly prospects for the 2007 cereals crops favourable despite slow start to season in parts\nIn Eastern Africa, the 2007 main season cereal crops are at different stages, from planting to maturing, except for Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan where sowing is not due to commence until late May-June. In Kenya, the 2007 long-rains season is well advanced in the main growing areas. Planting prospects have improved with a significant increase in precipitation in past weeks. Delayed onset of the long rains, coupled with late harvesting of the previous short rains crop due to the continuation of unseasonable rains well into February, resulted in reduced planting in March and April. The recent good rains have also benefited north-eastern pastoral areas but moisture deficits are reported in south-eastern parts. In Somalia, good rains in the second decade of April benefited planting of the 2007 main “Gu” crops, which is underway. However, current displacement of population due to the recent escalation of the civil conflict is likely to reduce the area planted, particularly in areas surrounding Mogadishu. Following heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands, water levels of the Shabelle River are rising and a moderate flood warning has been issued. In Uganda, abundant rains in the second dekad of April improved prospects for planting of the 2007 first season in southern bi-modal areas, where field operations had been delayed by dry weather in March. Precipitation was also good in the main producing areas of the north where sowing begins from April. In the United Republic of Tanzania, well distributed seasonal rains across much of the country provided favourable growing conditions for the 2007 maize crop, which in the grain basket region of the southern highlands is due for harvest from mid-May, and in the bi-modal northern production areas is at the reproductive stage. Pasture conditions and water levels in dams across the country have also improved significantly.\nHarvesting of the 2006/07 secondary season crops is completed in most countries of the region except in Ethiopia, where the “belg” crop is scheduled to be harvested from June. The outlook is favourable following normal to above-normal rainfall during the season in the producing areas of the south-western Ethiopian highlands. The availability of pasture and water in southern and south-eastern pastoral areas has also improved. In Sudan, harvesting of the 2006/07 wheat crop is completed and the output is estimated above average reflecting a sharp increase in plantings in response to sustained demand.\nFAO’s latest estimate puts the subregion’s aggregate 2006/07 cereal output (main and secondary seasons) at 34.7 million tonnes (including rice in milled terms), about 13 percent above the good level of the previous year and a record high.\nTable 8. Africa cereal production ( million tonnes)\nNote: Totals computed from unrounded data.\nCereal prices well below their levels of a year earlier in most countries\nFollowing good 2006 cereal crops in most countries of the subregion, food prices have generally declined since harvest time, except in Ethiopia where they are above their average levels despite a significant increase in production. According to information from the Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network (RATIN), wholesale maize prices are well below their levels of a year ago, although they recovered slightly in April, in Kenya and Uganda. In the United Republic of Tanzania, where the 2007 main season cereal crops are about to be gathered, prices started to decline in March in anticipation of a good harvest (Figures 4 and 5).\nDespite improved food supply millions face serious food difficulties\nNotwithstanding the general improvement in food supply, millions of people in the subregion face serious food difficulties due to the effects of localized drought conditions and the effects of ongoing and past conflicts. The situation in southern Somalia is of particular concern as the security situation continues to deteriorate (see box). Current estimates of the number of people who are expected to receive food assistance in 2007 in Eastern Africa are given in Table 9.\nTable 9. Planned Number of People to receive food aid in Eastern Africa (as of end March 2007)\nLower maize harvests in most countries but bumper crop in Malawi\nIn Southern Africa, harvest of the 2007 main season cereal crops is underway. Although the cumulative rains of the 2006/07 season were near normal in most countries, the season was characterized by a late start, excessive precipitation and dry spells of three weeks or longer, causing significant crop losses. In general, northern areas of the region received relatively good rains but southern parts faced extreme dry conditions accompanied by high temperatures. Pending the results of the ongoing FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Missions in Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland, and production estimates from other countries, the subregion’s aggregate 2007 maize crop is forecast by FAO at about 14.6 million tonnes, slightly lower than the 2006 level and about 7 percent below the five-year average (Table 10). In South Africa, the largest producer of the subregion, the maize harvest is expected to increase 3 percent from last year’s poor level, but to remain about 26 percent below the average of 2002-06. In spite of a recovery in plantings, in response to favourable maize prices, yields were sharply reduced by drought conditions in the main maize growing areas of the country. However, the adverse effects of dry weather have been more marked in the sector of subsistence agriculture where production is expected to decline by one-third from 2006. Unlike last year, the aggregate maize production of the subregion excluding South Africa, is forecast to decline 5 percent from the good level of 2006 but to remain above the average. Smaller cereal crops than last year are expected in most countries of the subregion, except for Malawi and Angola. In Zimbabwe, the Government has declared 2006/07 as a “drought year”, due to erratic and inadequate rainfall. While maize seed availability improved this season, the persisting economic crisis resulted in shortages of fertilizers, mechanical power and human labour. Early forecasts for the maize harvest from different sources point to a significant drop from last year’s good crop. Severe dry weather during the 2006/07 agricultural season has also adversely affected the 2007 cereal harvests in Lesotho and Swaziland. In Madagascar, dry weather and high temperatures in southern parts, where the maize crop is grown, sharply reduced this year’s production, but the main paddy crop is expected to be average. In Namibia, severe flooding in the lowland areas of the important growing Caprivi region resulted in serious crop losses, while dry weather reduced yields in the “maize triangle” around Grootfontein. Official forecasts point to a maize crop one-third below the good level of 2006, but still average. In Zambia, dry weather in southern parts adversely affected maize production but the northern half of the country had abundant rains and good yields are expected in those areas despite localized losses to flood. Overall, the 2007 maize output is expected well below last year’s bumper crop but still at normal to above-normal levels. Similarly, in Mozambique, floods in central parts and severe dry weather in southern provinces reduced maize production in those areas, but in northern areas and in highland areas of the Zambezi Valley good crops are being obtained. The secondary cropping season is also expected to be good after the floods have receded and, in aggregate, this year’s maize crop is forecast to be average although smaller than in 2006. In Bostwana, insufficient and erratic rains during the 2006/07 growing season also resulted in a sharp decline in cereal production from last year but the output is still expected to be average. In Malawi, abundant and well distributed rains, coupled with improved availability of agricultural inputs following a government fertilizer subsidy scheme, are expected to produce another bumper maize harvest this year. Official preliminary estimates indicate a maize crop of 3.1 million tonnes, well above the good level of 2006 and record. As a result, the country will have a large exportable maize surplus in marketing year 2007/08 (April/March). Similarly, in Angola, a good maize harvest is anticipated due to the continuing increase in area planted, following the settlement of returnees, accompanied by favourable rains during this season and improved access to seed and fertilizer. However, excessive rains in central areas and dry weather in southern parts resulted in localized crop losses.\nProspects for planting of the 2007 wheat crop and other secondary season crops from May are favourable in northern areas due to late heavy rains resulting in improved soil moisture. In South Africa, which accounts for about 90 percent of the subregion’s wheat production, planting intentions indicate a slight increase in the area which, however, will remain below the five-year average. The increase in plantings reflects higher domestic and international prices since the beginning of the year, as well as the better growing conditions.\nTable 10. Southern Africa maize production: ( 000 tonnes)\n1 Preliminary forecast pending FAO/WFP CFSAM assessments in Zimbabwe, lesotho and Swaziland and other assessments in other countries.\nCereal imports to increase in 2007/08\nReflecting the anticipated lower 2007 maize crops in most countries, the aggregate maize import requirement of the subregion, excluding South Africa, in the 2007/08 marketing year (April/March in most cases) is forecast close to 1.6 million tonnes, up from the previous year’s 1.1 million tonnes (Figure 6). Food assistance requirements for large numbers of people affected by localized floods and dry weather are tentatively projected to increase to about 380 000 tonnes, for maize alone, compared to the estimate of 107 000 tonnes received during 2006/07. This, however, is below the average level of maize food aid received during the previous five years.\nMaize export prices higher than a year earlier in South Africa\nExport prices of white maize in South Africa (in U.S. Dollar terms), that had been rising since planted time last November, declined in April with the beginning of the harvest but remained well above their levels of a year earlier reflecting a second consecutive poor maize harvest. SAFEX future prices show a positive trend from May till December 2007. High prices in South Africa, the region’s main exporting country, have affected Swaziland, Lesotho and other structural import dependent markets in the region. By contrast, prices of maize in Malawi declined in February and March in anticipation of a record harvest and a potential large exportable surplus. In several other countries of the subregion, current prices of maize, the most important staple food, are also below the corresponding levels a year ago. In Madagascar, sustained heavy rains in past months have disrupted the rice supplies resulting in steep rise in rice prices (Figure 7).\nOverall, the regional food supply is anticipated to be tighter in marketing year 2007/08 (May/April). In South Africa, official information points to an exportable surplus of white maize (for human consumption) of 587 000 tonnes, well below the level of 2006/07. However, after two consecutive bumper crops, Malawi has emerged as a potential exporter with a large maize surplus. It has been reported that Malawi is negotiating the sale of 400 000 tonnes of maize to Zimbabwe.\nFavourable prospects for winter grains\nProspects for the winter grain crops (mostly wheat), that are in the latter development stages or nearing harvest throughout the main producing countries remain generally favourable. In China, recent rainfall and warm temperatures have been favourable for the reproductive development of winter wheat and for planting of maize and rice in the major producing area. Current forecasts point to a wheat output of about 99 million tonnes in 2007, close to the five–year average but almost 5 percent lower than last year. The wheat area was reduced as a result of dry weather during the planting season and early growing period. In India, reflecting continuing favourable weather, the 2007 wheat output forecast has been revised up to 73.5 million tonnes. This would be 6 percent up from last year reflecting area expansion and favourable weather during most of the growing season. As a result, wheat imports in 2007/08 are forecast to be much lower at 2 million tonnes, compared to 6.5 million tonnes in the previous marketing year. Similarly, the forecast for Pakistan’s wheat output this year has also been revised up, by 1 million tonnes, to a record 23 million tonnes, 15 percent above the five-year average. The good results are attributable to increased fertilizer subsidies, allowing farmers to raise application rates, and favourable weather. Given the increase in domestic wheat supplies expected, the country is expected to export some 1.5 million tonnes of wheat in 2007/08. By contrast, a smaller wheat crop is in prospect in Bangladesh due to unseasonably high temperatures during the important winter development period. As a result, the country’s wheat imports in 2007/08 are expected to increase to about 2.8 million tonnes.\nOverall rice prospects are mixed\nIn Indonesia, output of the 2007 main season rice crop, which is already well advanced, is forecast to fall by about 2 percent, following a 3 percent cut in plantings caused by the late arrival of the north-east monsoon rainfall, normally due in September–October, but which only reached the country in December. Harvesting of main Maha season paddy crop in Sri Lanka is complete and output is estimated at an above-average level. Dry season rice prospects in Thailand, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, and Vietnam are generally satisfactory.\nFood supply difficulties persist in several countries\nDespite an overall satisfactory food supply situation in the subregion, vulnerable populations in a number of countries are still affected by serious food supply difficulties. The main food security concerns centre on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste.\nIn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, despite an above-average main cereal output in 2006, and generally favourable prospects for the current secondary cropping season, a significant deficit in cereals during the current marketing year (November/October) 2006/07 is estimated. Although the Republic of Korea has recently agreed to provide 400 000 tonnes of rice to its neighbour, some 510 000 tonnes of deficit still remains in 2006/07, which needs to be covered by additional food aid and commercial imports (see box). In Timor-Leste, the 2007 cereal production, including cassava and other tubers, has been severely affected by adverse weather conditions, especially in the northern provinces, where rains have been erratic. Furthermore, crops in some western parts have been affected by an outbreak of locusts. A recent FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission has estimated output of maize, the most important crop in the country, to be about 30 percent below the average of the last few years. Although the tight food supply situation experienced in February and March, following disruption of normal importing and marketing activities, is reported to have eased somewhat in April, it is estimated that emergency food aid is needed for about 40 percent of the population. In addition, emergency rice and maize seed assistance is needed for the second crop season, starting in May. A detailed analysis of the food supply and demand situation by the recent Mission will be available soon.\nTable 11. Asia cereal production ( million tonnes)\nNote: Totals computed from unrounded data.\nThe 2007 wheat crop in Nepal, normally accounting for some 22 percent of total cereal production, is being harvested. Following excellent growing conditions this season, production has been estimated, by a recent FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission, at a record 1.46 million tonnes, about 7 percent above the average of the past five years. However, food insecurity is still a big concern for the households severely affected by last year’s droughts, especially in the worst-affected districts of the Eastern region, where crop losses amounted to 25 percent on average and over 40 percent in some districts such as Siraha and Saptari. Due to low productivity and poor market access, many households in the Far-Western and Mid-West regions are extremely poor and suffer from chronic food shortages. Many households in Terai (plain) are also vulnerable to food insecurity as a result of civil strife and chronic poverty. WFP has started and emergency operation to provide food assistance in Far-Western and Mid-West regions since January 2007.\nIn Sri Lanka, despite a record crop gathered last year, the food situation in the northeast of the country is still significantly affected by the deterioration of the security situation. In the Philippines, despite an overall satisfactory food supply situation, recent conflict between the rebel Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Government has reportedly displaced more than 45 000 people, raising concerns over their food security. In China, the Sichuan province has been affected by strong winds and hail storms in mid-April, with a devastating effect on the agriculture. About 38 000 hectares are reported to be affected to varying degrees. There is concern over the food security of the affected population.\nGenerally favourable outlook for 2007 crops about to be harvested\nIn the Near East, the 2007 main winter cereal crops, mainly wheat, are about to be harvested. Favourable weather conditions since the beginning of the season have been reported for several countries. The overall status of winter crops at the end of March was rated close to the previous year, when an average crop was obtained.\nRecent reports on the desert locust situation indicate that as a result of unusually good rains during April, desert locust swarms have laid eggs in the interior of Saudi Arabia, along both sides of the Red Sea and in the interior of Yemen. Survey and control operations are urged to be maintained in affected countries.\nIn Iraq, the deteriorating humanitarian situation continues to affect the entire population with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and insecurity that is disrupting lives and livelihoods in many parts of the country. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), some 50 000 people leave Iraq every month seeking refuge. Overall, nearly 1.8 million are internally displaced and 2 million have fled to neighbouring countries.\nIn Afghanistan, recent flash floods from torrential rains and fast snow-melt, following a sudden rise in temperatures, have caused significant damages to lives and livelihoods in most regions of the country. However, despite localized damage, overall prospects are favourable for this year’s cereal production, and aggregate cereal output (rice in milled terms) is now forecast at about 4.9 million tonnes, which is considered above average.\nAnother good cereal harvest forecast this year\nIn the Asian CIS region prospects for 2007 cereal production remain favourable following a mild winter, adequate soil moisture and slightly above average snow cover in the mountainous areas of the region, ensuring sufficient irrigation water throughout spring and summer. Torrential rains and floods have caused some localized damages in parts of the region, which does not affect the forecast cereal output estimated at just under 30 million tonnes, some half a million tonnes up on last year’s good harvest. Kazakhstan is the largest cereal producer in the region accounting for 55 percent of the region’s total output and nearly 95 percent of its production is planted in spring under extensive rain-fed conditions. Kazakhstan has become a significant player in the international grain market and is seeking new markets in the Near East, North and East Africa. The forecast cereal output in the region includes some 24.8 million tonnes of wheat and about 4.6 million tonnes of coarse grains, mainly barley and maize.\nCentral America and the Caribbean\nGood start of the 2007 main rainy season\nIn Mexico, harvesting of the 2007 main season irrigated wheat crop, accounting for some 90 percent of the annual production, is well advanced. As a result of adequate water supplies in the north-western producing states of Sonora and Baja California, a good crop is expected for the second consecutive year. Mexico is the sole producer of wheat in the subregion and latest official forecasts indicate an output of about 3 million tonnes, close to the level of last year’s same season.\nSowing of the 2007 main season coarse grains and paddy crops has started or is about to start in the subregion. Normal to above-normal rains in April in most countries provided adequate soil moisture for planting and early prospects are favourable. In particular, in Haiti and Dominican Republic, good precipitation since March favoured an early start of the main season maize crop and benefited other foodcrops in the ground.\nThe subregion’s aggregate 2006 cereal production is estimated at 37 million tonnes, higher than in the previous year and above average. Good cereal crops were obtained in most countries, except in Nicaragua affected by dry weather, and in Costa Rica due to lower plantings. In Haiti the overall food security situation is reported to have improved with the good 2006 first and second season harvests and a general improvement of the economic situation. Prices of basic food by the end of March were stable or declining. By contrast, in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, prices of main staple maize have been increasing since December reflecting higher quotations in the international markets.\nRecord 2007 coarse grain output\nHarvesting of the 2007 main season coarse grain crops is well advanced in the main producing southern countries of the subregion. Record or above-average crops are being gathered in most countries. FAO’s latest forecast puts the subregion’s aggregate coarse grain production, mainly maize, close to 90.5 million tonnes, 22 percent above the average level of 2006 and the highest on record. This reflects an increase of 6 percent in the area planted in response to strong demand for ethanol production, and record yields. In Argentina, despite excessive rains and floods in late March and April, recent official forecast point to a record maize production of 22 million tonnes, 52 percent above last year’s level, due to an increase of 11 percent in plantings and record yields. In Brazil, the output of the main season maize crop is expected at 36 million tonnes, 16 percent more than the 2006 same season. Early prospects for the second season maize crops, now being sown, are promising with record plantings anticipated in response to increased international prices; the output is projected to increase by one-quarter to 14 million tonnes. A record 2007 maize crop is also being gathered in Chile. In Uruguay, the outlook for a bumper crop this year may not materialize due to heavy floods in early May, reported to be the worst in fifty years, that have displaced thousands of people and severely damaged crops and livestock.\nTable 12. Latin America and Caribbean cereal production ( million tonnes)\nNote: Totals computed from unrounded data.\nIn Andean countries, severe floods and dry weather reduced the 2007 cereal and potato crops in Bolivia (see box). In Peru, despite overall favourable prospects for this year’s cereal output, frost and hailstorms in mountain areas, where harvest is underway, adversely affected small farmers’ cereal and potato production.\nAdverse weather brings damage to wheat and delays maize planting\nThe outlook for the 2007 wheat crop in the United States deteriorated in early April following a period of freezing temperatures and storms, a sudden change from earlier warm conditions that had advanced plant growth ahead of normal for the time of year. Although it is still too early to assess the full extent of the damage, early indications point to damage of varying degrees on up to 70 percent of the crop in the major producing central and southern wheat belt. The effects of the adverse weather are reflected in the USDA winter wheat condition ratings, which declined sharply, to 54 percent rated good to excellent, compared to 64 percent in the week before the adverse weather. However, as the situation stands in late April, the overall crop rating remains relatively good compared to the past few years, with very high condition ratings still reported in some states. FAO now forecasts the United States wheat crop at an about-average 55 million tonnes, after a tentative adjustment for the recent damage, based on the information available to date.\nAs of late April, maize planting in the United States was still in its early stages and progressing much slower than last year and the average because of the adverse weather in the first half of the month. However, plenty time still remains for planting if weather conditions improve soon and the maize area is expected to increase sharply in response to growing demand from ethanol producers and for export. According to the USDA Prospective Plantings report of 30 March, the area intended for maize is seen to rise by some 15 percent to 36.6 million hectares, the largest area since 1944.\nIn Canada, planting of the main 2007 grain crops is underway. Late season snowfall is reported to have improved moisture conditions in some areas where dryness prevailed from last year, but some parts, especially southern Saskatchewan would still benefit from more moisture. According the Statistics Canada Planting Intentions report of 24 April, Canadian farmers intend to reduce sharply the area planted to spring wheat (the major cereal), in favour of durum wheat, barley, oats or non-cereals such as canola or field peas, which are expected to generate better returns this year.\nLarger cereals crops in prospects but more rains needed for full potential to materialize\nIn the European Union, latest prospects still point to an increase in cereal production in 2007. The aggregate cereal area for harvest in the 27 countries is forecast to be up by 2 percent on the previous year, which combined with expectations for higher average yields because of generally better growing conditions, could result in a growth of 4 percent in the aggregate output. However, with dry and warm conditions prevailing across a large area of northern and central Europe in April, for current forecasts to hold, some good rains will be needed soon in these areas. The countries concerned include France, the EU’s major cereal producer. On current forecasts, France is expected to account for a large part of the increase forecast in the group’s 2007 cereal output, mostly due to increasing its wheat area, and given the likely recovery in yields from drought-reduced levels last year. By contrast to the predominantly dry central and northern parts, the southwest received some helpful rain in the past few weeks. Although hindering spring fieldwork, the precipitation was overall beneficial, improving soil moisture levels and reservoir levels in the Iberian Peninsula where water has been scarce in the past two years especially. Also in the eastern EU countries, recent rains have improved the outlook for the developing cereal crops. Concern had been building earlier in Hungary and Bulgaria over the lack of soil moisture after a particularly dry winter but latest reports indicate that the recent rains should ensure that at least average yields are achieved.\nIn the European CIS, generally favourable weather conditions, adequate soil moisture and lack of frost in March and April have favoured development of the winter grains and enabled farmers to nearly complete spring cereal planting, almost a month ahead of schedule. This is in contrast to the normal seasonal conditions of cold snaps and frost in March-April, which can often compromise significant areas of winter cereals and delay spring planting. The aggregate area planted with cereals for harvest in 2007 is estimated at about 60.8 million hectares, 1.4 million hectares up on last year. Spring cereals account for more than two-thirds of the aggregate area planted with cereals. Based on the area estimates and the generally favourable growing conditions, the aggregate 2007 cereal output in the subregion is now forecast at about 123.6 million tonnes, nearly 5 million tonnes up on last year. The aggregate output in the subregion this year includes nearly 66 million tonnes of wheat and just over 57 million tonnes of coarse grains, mainly barley and maize.\nElsewhere in Europe, the main cereal producing country not in either of the preceding groups is Serbia. Latest information indicates favourable prospects for this year’s production, with increases in both the wheat and maize areas expected. Given good weather conditions for wheat during most of the winter, a sharp increase in output is expected. Current indications also point to a slightly larger maize crop.\nAustralian farmers anxiously await rains for planting 2007 winter grains\nPlanting of winter grains in Australia is due to start in May. With subsoil moisture at very low levels, the prospects are entirely dependant on the timely arrival of good rains to coincide with the planting window in the main producing areas. Farmers’ planting intentions continue to point to the likelihood of an above-average area if normal seasonal rainfall arrives, by mid-to-end May. On this basis, FAO currently maintains its forecast for a sharp recovery in the country’s wheat output after the drought-reduced output last year.\nTable 13.

{"text": "Illustrator & Printmaker Extraordinaire\nI first saw Alice Pattullo’s work in January 2012 when I played with the Cecil Sharp Project at the Cecil Sharp House in London. Her work hung in a huge exhibit all over the walls of the center, and I immediately fell in love with her style and subject matter. Her images and the way she drew reminded me of adored southern outsider artists and folk artists such as Howard Finster and Theora Hamblett. I bought a copy of Apple Wassailing, as my friends Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman had told me about the long tradition of singing to the apple trees in Devon each January.\nAfter returning home to the United States, I kept thinking about Alice Pattullo. I looked at her blog and website and saw that she had studied in Minneapolis MN for a year. I decided that somehow, because of that, she might draw some images for me as a means of collaboration for the new album. I wrote her and she immediately responded. Our artistic relationship began.\nI explained my basic concept for three images, all based on specific songs off of the album, Camilla. Alice started with the song “White Dress”, based on the 24-year-old Mae Frances Moultrie and her participation in the Freedom Riders movement in 1961. Moultrie rode the infamous Anniston, Alabama bus that exploded. I told Alice that Moultrie stepped off the bus and into the seething mob, which was waiting for her, in a white dress, white pumps, and white earrings. I also told Alice that my favorite personal heroes of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement were Diane Nash, Fannie Lou Hamer, James Lawson and Bob Moses.\nHere’s what Alice designed:\nNext, Alice began work on “Black Mountain Lullaby”, a song I wrote with the Cecil Sharp Project about the death of Jeremy Davidson, a three-year-old who lived in a trailer with his family outside of mountainous Appalachia, Virginia. The Davidsons lived just below a ridge where coal companies were widening roads so they could bring in larger trucks to cut off the top of the ridge, a form of the mountaintop removal style of coal mining. One fateful evening in 2004, trucks pushed a large boulder over the side of the ridge. It bounded down the mountain and literally rolled through the Davidson’s trailer, crushing Jeremy in his bed.\nI told Alice that we made the song into a mother’s lullaby after one of the Cecil Sharp Project members found a Sharp song collection fragment that read, “bye, baby, baby bye”.\nAlice then began work on the image “Traveling Shoes”, but soon into it I decided that Alice had to design the album cover instead! That panel contains images from several songs. Perhaps most prevalent are those from the song “Fireflies”, including a little girl in her nightgown and a house on fire. We also took images and information from the official website of Camilla, Georgia, a small, picturesque town that farms peanuts and raises cattle. In the shadow background on the right one can see Marion King taking her casserole and her children to the Camilla jail, walking towards an incident upon which the title track “Camilla” is based.\nThe town of Camilla, GA, close in name to my hometown of Canton, and also representative of so many southern towns, sits between two rivers, both of which are shown on Alice’s panel. The hanging shoes towards the top are from the song “Traveling Shoes,” based on a short story by Eudora Welty. One can also see the shadow of Phoenix Jackson, the protagonist of the story, in the shadow background on the left. Alice’s interpretation of this Welty character features much more prominently on my poster (see below).\nLastly, I told Alice that I love camellias, a winter-blooming rose family. She chose the birds, which fly in several of my songs.\nAfter we finished the initial project, I asked Alice to make a poster for me. After some discussion we decided to have her superimpose images on top of my black and white press photo. She included characters and other stylistic references from many of my songs and from all of the above images. I love that she also included me as\na character amongst them. I asked to wear a red dress, based completely on the red dress I bought when I was in London in January 2012 (with my friends Jackie Oates and Kathryn Roberts). I wore it when I played at the Cecil Sharp House and bought my apple-wassailing lithograph.\n– Caroline Herring\nFor more information on Alice Pattullo, please visit"}
{"text": "You are hereHome >\nWashington, D.C. - Statement of Nasima Hossain, U.S. PIRG Public Health Advocate, on the USDA’s decision to buy 7 million pounds of ammonia treated meats for school lunches.\nAn article in the Huffington Post on March 5, 2012 cites the USDA buying 7 million pounds of pink slime for the national school lunch program. It is blended into hamburger patties and sausages and is being used to feed the nation’s children. Pink slim is ammonia-treated meat trimmings, that are the connective tissue, intestines and parts of the animal not used in regular beef cuts, instead of muscle; and food experts say it is not nutritionally equivalent to ground beef. It was even rejected recently by fast food corporations like McDonalds, Burger King and Taco Bell.\n“Does the USDA really think this is the type of product that parents would knowingly want their children to eat? Parents have a right to know what is in their children’s school lunches; and the USDA should ensure that meats used for the program are high quality meats that are nutritious.\n“As a parent I would be extremely concerned to hear that my child was being fed hamburgers using meat trimmings that even fast food giants like McDonalds, Burger King and Taco Bell do not use anymore. The USDA should immediately re-examine their practice of using lean beef trimmings in school lunches.”\nThe overuse of antibiotics on factory farms is threatening the effectiveness of lifesaving antibiotics.

{"text": "Cilantro is an amazing culinary herb that has become a staple in cuisines around the globe. People either love or hate its cleansing floral aroma that hints of soap and perfume. Right now our cilantro in the garden is representing a full life-cycle and a number of culinary applications.\nCoriander and cilantro are different words for the same plant - but it is more common for fresh leaves to be referred to as cilantro and dried seeds to be referred to as coriander. The seeds and leaves, while similar, each have distinct characteristics and applications. As the plant ages, the leaves towards the top of the plant become frond-like and take on a bit of the bitterness and complexity similar to the seed’s flavor profile. Soon after this happens, the plant produces tiny white and pink flowers that are one step closer to the flavor of coriander seeds. A week or so after the flowers emerge bunches of fluorescent green seeds form between the flowers. When these seeds are dried they become the brittle pale bb’s found in spice cabinets around the world, but in their fresh state they pop with an intense aroma.\nOften overlooked here in the US, the plant’s roots are prized in South East Asia where they are a staple in curries and soups. When pulled from the ground they resemble small,\nfibrous parsnips. Their flavor is similar to the leaves, but deeper and less bright. The benefit of using the root is that unlike the leaves, that quickly lose their aroma and turn bitter when heated, the root retains its mellow aroma when heated in a sauce or braise."}
{"text": "A Guide to Non-Disclosure Agreements\nA Non-Disclosure Agreement, or NDA, is one of our most highly requested contracts—but what exactly is it? An NDA is an agreement between two parties, typically a “Disclosing Party” and a “Receiving Party”, in which confidential and proprietary information is both protected and prevented from being shared with others. In a nutshell, as a small business owner and entrepreneur with innovative ideas, an NDA can help prevent those ideas from being stolen or used in an unwanted way.\nUnilateral NDA vs. Mutual NDA\nLike most agreements, there’s more than one type of NDA. The two primary types of NDAs are: unilateral and mutual (or bilateral). A unilateral non-disclosure agreement is beneficial in circumstances in which only one party is disclosing confidential information. This type of NDA may be useful in a situation where you are interested in bringing on a new partner to your business, which may involve disclosing financial information, marketing strategies, a process, etc. On the other hand, a mutual non-disclosure agreement is utilized in circumstances in which both parties are sharing confidential information with each other. This may be useful in a situation where you are contemplating merging your business with another business, requiring both parties to disclose and exchange certain proprietary information. Overall, a unilateral and mutual NDA are not wildly different, but we advise that you contact an attorney in your state to determine which type of NDA is right for you and your business.\nWhen Might I Utilize an NDA for my Business?\nNow that we’ve discussed the primary types of NDAs that are available, you may be wondering when exactly you will utilize one and is it actually necessary. Generally speaking, an NDA can be used any time confidential information is shared with another individual or business. To help you decide if an NDA will benefit you and your business, we’ve compiled a list of the most common scenarios that you may encounter in the management of your business in which an NDA can be utilized:\nEmployees– Most businesses have employees, right? Well it’s highly likely that your employees are exposed to certain pertinent confidential information that non-employees do not have access to. If you’ve had employees with you from the very beginning, they may be privy to your specialized processes or even your client or customer lists. Unless you already have a written non-compete agreement in place, what’s stopping an employee from opening their own competing business using your client list and specialized process?\nPotential New Partners or Members– Maybe you started your business as a sole proprietor or a single-member limited liability company, and now you’re expanding and ready to bring on a partner or member. A potential partner may want to know how you developed the product, your marketing strategy, your price list, etc. Remember the key word here, “potential”, so you don’t want to make the mistake of disclosing this information without an agreement in place to protect it.\nProspective Investors– Not every entrepreneur has unlimited funds to start and maintain their business, and at some point, you may want to speak with investors so that you can raise funds and keep building your business. A prospective investor may want to see your business’s financial records to determine whether the business is truly as profitable as you say it is. It’s likely you’ll converse with several prospective investors, so you’ll want to ensure your financial records remain confidential.\nMarketing Services– Some businesses may hire social media influencers or other marketing experts to help promote their brand, product or service, which may involve giving access to the business’s website, social media accounts, and email marketing campaigns. In this day and age, social media is key to how a business operates and its reputation. Many businesses spend thousands on marketing and building their social media presence, so it would be a shame if an asset of that nature weren’t protected to the fullest extent possible.\nMergers and Acquisitions– Now that you’ve spent countless amounts of time and money building a successful business, you may be interested in selling to or merging with another company. Naturally, there will be financial, management, operational, and other proprietary information shared in this scenario, and not every merger or acquisition ends in a successful deal. Not only will you be sharing your confidential information to another company, but they will be sharing their own confidential information with you - so a mutual NDA would benefit both parties greatly in the long run.\nAs entrepreneurs and small business owners, we know just how valuable your business is, and we’re not just talking about money. We want to help keep your innovative ideas protected. If you’re located in Massachusetts or Connecticut, contact Marti Law Group today for a free 30-minute consultation: email@example.com"}

{"text": "Courts previously deemed Hill’s death sentence valid based on the testimony of several experts who claimed he was not, in fact, intellectually disabled. Yet, as Judge Rosemary Barkett explains in a dissenting opinion, “all three experts who previously testified for the state of Georgia in 2000 that Hill did not meet the criteria for mental retardation have recently come forward and said they made a grievous mistake. They explained that their earlier conclusions were unreliable and that it is now their professional opinion that Hill is mentally retarded.” So Hill’s death sentence is rooted in unreliable evidence that has since been overcome by new information, and he asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to overturn the death sentence that mentally health experts now unanimously agree is unconstitutional.\nExcept that there’s one big problem, a 1996 law known as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) generally does not allow what are known as a “second or successive habeas corpus application,” meaning that a prisoner typically gets one chance to challenge their conviction or sentence in federal court, and that’s it. Prior to when the witnesses against him recanted their testimony, Hill sought a federal court order invalidating his death sentence on the grounds that he is intellectually disabled, and lost. And, while AEDPA does contain an exception for newly discovered information establishing a prisoner’s innocence, this exception does not allow a guilty person to challenge an unconstitutionally excessive sentence based on new evidence.\nAs Andrew Cohen explains, there are some aspects of the court’s analysis that are highly doubtful, even if the court ultimately reads AEDPA correctly to say that it more important to prevent someone from challenging their death sentence twice than it is to halt unconstitutional executions. Cohen also points to what may be the most stunning statement in the court’s majority opinion:\nIf all that was required to reassert years later a previously rejected claim was a change in testimony, every material witness would have the power to upset every notion of finality by simply changing his testimony. And, as this case illustrates, opinion testimony can be changed with great ease (indeed, even without seeing Hill in 13 years, administering any new tests, or reviewing new documents, three witnesses pivoted their positions 180 degrees). Moreover, there is no reason to limit the change in evidence theory to changes in testimony of previous witnesses. New witnesses could be rounded up, and every new witness would transform the same old claim into a brand new one (citations omitted by me).\nThe first sentence of this passage is simply breathtaking. Imagine, the court demands, how terrible the world would be if death sentences could be overruled just because the facts supporting those sentences turn out to be false!\nAt the end of the day, we can have a justice system that favors truth, or we can have a justice system that favors finality. AEDPA forces us to choose the later."}

The programme is a real curiosity containing rarities from French composers Fauré, Ravel and Poulenc. Fischer-Dieskau is accompanied by Wolfgang Sawallisch the eminent conductor who is also a highly regarded pianist. The chamber ensemble comprises members of the Berliner Philharmoniker including violinist Thomas Brandis who was the orchestra’s concertmaster at the time of the recording.\nWe start with Fauré’s La bonne chanson, a song cycle of nine mélodies originally for voice and piano composed in 1892/94. The song cycle is based on poems from Paul Verlaine’s collection of the same name. In 1898 Fauré produced a version for voice, piano and string quartet, however, that performed here includes a double bass. It’s a fine vehicle for Fischer-Dieskau who clearly relishes the broad character of Fauré’s settings. Ravel’s Chansons madécasses (Songs of Madagascar) is a set of three for voice, flute, cello and piano written in 1925/26 to texts by Evariste Parny. It offers a compelling blend of sensuality, sorrow and acrimony and Fischer-Dieskau embraces all this with considerable success. Poulenc’s cantata Le bal masqué (The masked ball) for voice and chamber ensemble was composed in 1932 a setting of poetry by Max Jacob. The chamber ensemble employed here comprises oboe, clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, piano, violin, cello and percussion. Divided by two instrumental-only interludes these are vibrant, colourful and frequently quirky pieces. Featuring rhythmic and highly percussive writing this set is easily enjoyed with the brilliant instrumentation as prominent as the vocal part.\nFischer-Dieskau was one of the finest baritones of his generation. He really digs the meaning of the texts. I find his singing characterful with splendid enunciation; if a touch mannered at times. The chamber accompaniment is as flawless as one would expect from the pedigree of these players.\nIn truth this re-issue of French songs doesn’t have wide allure and will appeal mainly to Fischer-Dieskau devotees. The sound which is stated as being re-mastered is brightly lit, generally satisfying but occasionally uncomfortably fierce at the top. I have seen details of this recording when it was released in 1976 as a 33 1/3 rpm vinyl LP. Unlike the original recording this Acanta re-issue sadly has no texts and following a link in the booklet was a waste of time. There is more than enough space in the booklet to have accommodated the sung texts and translations.\nThis disc of French songs will appeal mainly to Fischer-Dieskau devotees.\nSupport us financially by purchasing this disc from:"}

And it is evident beyond all contradiction, that our Lord sprung from his tribe, ( Hebrews 7:14 ) . The reason why the brethren of Judah, who were eleven in number, are mentioned, when the brethren of Isaac and Jacob are not, is, because though the Messiah did not spring from them, yet the promise of him was made to the twelve tribes, who all expected him, and to whom he was sent, and came.

This approach was chosen for several reasons:\n- It is relatively simple to implement.\n- It allows us to view and modify parameters passed to an API function, change return values of that function, and run any other code we desire.\n- While most other methods require code to be injected into the target process or run from an external application, DLL redirection requires only write access to the target application's working directory.\n- We can intercept any API call without modifying the target (either on disk or in memory) or any system files.\nLet us know what you think or if you have questions for Craig."}
{"text": "The Scottish Funding Council (SFC), together with the original MASTS member institutions, invested approximately £75M between 2009-2016 in developing MASTS. MASTS (Phase I) was launched on 4th November 2009 in Edinburgh.\nMASTS had the ambition to become an integral and important part of the national framework of excellence in marine science in Scotland and was awarded an additional five years of funding for MASTS Phase II. Modest funding is received from the SFC, but the majority of MASTS funding is now provided by contributions from its Member organisations. We continue to work hard to become self-supporting as an independent entity beyond the SFC funding period. In 2023, MASTS enters phase III.\nThis pooling of marine research talent has a constituency of more than 700 researchers with the management of resources consisting of over £66 million annually.\nMASTS supports this high level strategy by promoting and delivering science and training of the highest standard to better understand marine the marine environment. MASTS actively seeks to encourage productive dialogue and understanding between scientists, other marine experts and interested parties in all sectors, including those responsible for policy development and regulation.\nThe MASTS research agenda is driven by scientific excellence and contributes to the vision of ‘clean, healthy, safe, biologically diverse marine and coastal environments, managed to meet the long-term needs of people and nature’.\nResearch within MASTS is organised under three broad research themes:\nThese Research Themes are the largest and most inclusive groupings which reflect the Scottish Marine strategy and Scottish Government objectives in promoting clean, healthy, diverse and productive seas. Underneath each Theme, there are groupings called Research Forums, which are intended to be outward looking and to include all MASTS members who have an interest in those areas.\nForums are the main delivery mechanism for MASTS science. Although Forums are associated with a Research Theme, they may cut across other Themes. Forums can be established to address specific areas of research as they emerge but to receive funding and other MASTS support, they must be approved by the MASTS Executive Committee and operate within prescribed guidelines. Each Forum is led by a Convenor and has an annual networking budget.\nWe’re working behind the scenes to bring you a suite of useful, and updateable, resources including:\nIf you would like to be updated when the resources section is live please let us know."}
{"text": "Back in June, the US Chamber of Commerce, which represents business interests, filed a petition that asked the Environmental Protection Agency to revisit its decision, made in April, to treat greenhouse gasses as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The CoC requested open public hearings that would reexamine all aspects of the decision, from the science of climate change and ocean acidification to the projected impacts on public health and agriculture. Although there was nothing unusual or unexpected about that, the request appears to have been widely ignored. That seems to have ended, as the Chamber's real desire has become clear: it wants to subject climate science to a show trial.\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that this language is exaggerated, but it's sadly not. In discussions with the Los Angeles Times, Chamber representatives explicitly reference the Scopes trial, held in Tennessee, which created a media circus focused on the first of many US legal actions over the teaching of evolution.\nOne of the complaints is that the EPA's decision is based in part on the IPCC's reports, which it considers a secondary, potentially biased source. Apparently immune to irony, the Chamber references the same IPCC report where it reaches conclusions favorable to the Chamber.\nThe Scopes trial should provide ample historic precedent that a public trial like this neither clarifies the science nor unites the public. But disagreements over science fundamentally don't lend themselves to resolution via public opinion, and the petition makes it clear that the Chamber itself is likely to mangle any attempts at clarity.\nSeparating policy from science\nThere are two aspects to the EPA's decision, science- and policy-based, and the Chamber's petition attacks them both. The potential to regulate greenhouse gasses as pollutants stretches back to the end of the Clinton administration, which left the issue to its successor. The Bush administration, while accepting the scientific indications that these substances can alter the climate, made policy decisions not to regulate them, taking a losing battle all the way to the Supreme Court, and then arguing that existing legislation was not up to the task. The Obama administration has chosen a different policy, choosing to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gasses.\nDistilled down, the Chamber's argument on policy grounds is that the Bush administration had it right: handling this within the frameworks provided by existing legislation will be difficult, if not impossible.\nThere are some reasonable arguments to be made, as issues like ocean acidification and sea level rises will be difficult to approach within a simple regulatory framework, as they have implications for everything from the fishing industry to disaster management. At the same time, however, the administration's quick handling of automotive fuel economy standards (which occurred prior to the Chamber's petition) indicated that not everything was impossible at the policy level.\nAttacking the science\nIn any case, it's easy to argue that the policy debate was settled by Obama's election. Since the Bush administration seems to have largely accepted the same science as the current EPA, that should handle both prongs of the argument. Except it doesn't, at least in the Chamber's view. It correctly highlights that there are relevant areas where future projections of climate change have significant uncertainties, such as urban air quality and agricultural productivity. But the document also attacks some of the basic data behind climate change, suggesting that we aren't actually sure that the oceans' pH is dropping, or that the seas and temperatures are rising.\nOne of the complaints is that the EPA's decision is based in part on the IPCC's reports, which it considers a secondary, potentially biased source. Apparently immune to irony, the Chamber references the same IPCC report where it reaches conclusions favorable to the Chamber, and uses some of its own secondary sources, including reports by a someone who appears to have ties to a pro-coal lobbying group.\nBut it also relies on interpretations of scientific publications that the authors of said publications have explicitly disavowed, and raises arguments based on private websites that have staked a position in the climate debate. It would be tempting to think that if these guys got involved in a public trial of the science, they'd be in trouble, and the public would recognize it. Tempting, but probably wrong.\nThe one-way hash argument\nThe simple and wrong arguments take one sentence each; the detailed-but-correct one takes three paragraphs—and still required a lot of simplifications\nThe Chamber is explicitly looking to put climate science on trial, quoting a court ruling that states, \"cross-examination has always been considered a most effective way to ascertain truth,\" and saying they're looking to produce \"the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century.\" It's hard to imagine an outcome that could be worse. Decades later, we're still having court cases focused on the teaching of evolution, the losers are still trying to get their ideas into classrooms, and the public still has little idea of the scientific status of evolution.\nOne reason for this is that a cross examination is a lousy way to determine science, because all scientific conclusions are tentative and limited in various ways; there are always holes waiting to be picked at. But the other reason is that a trial situation is a great opportunity for people to confuse the public with what our former colleague Julian Sanchez termed a one-way hash argument.\nThe gist of this is that it can easy to make a simple, intuitive presentation of an argument that is simply wrong. In contrast, reality is often complex and counterintuitive, and providing all the details needed to understand it can be arduous. It's the difference between multiplying two prime numbers to encrypt something, and figuring out which prime numbers are needed to decrypt it.\nTo give an example from the climate debate, take the graph shown above, which follows both carbon dioxide levels and temperatures through several glacial cycles. A pro-climate change, one-way hash argument would note that the two always change in synchrony, hence CO2-driven climate change. The anti- equivalent would note that, if you look carefully, the temperatures start to rise ahead of the CO2 at the end of a glacial cycle, hence greenhouse gasses have nothing to do with it.\nAs it turns out, both the intuitive arguments are wrong. The regular glacial cycles are triggered by equally regular wobbles in the Earth's axis relative to the plane of its orbit. Although these wobbles, called Milankovitch cycles, don't change the total amount of sunlight hitting the Earth, they do change its distribution. That alone is enough to cause regional climate change, but not enough to drop the global temperature by several degrees.\nThat happens because the Milankovitch cycles set off feedback mechanisms that enhance their effect. Ice expands near the poles and reflects more sunlight back into space, for example. And, separately, atmospheric CO2 levels start to drop, which accentuates the drop in temperatures. To exit the glacial cycle, both processes need to reverse; changes in the distribution of sunlight can start to change the planet, but we wouldn't reach the temperatures we're currently enjoying in this interglacial if it weren't accompanied by feedbacks, including elevated greenhouse gas levels.\nSo, the simple and wrong arguments take one sentence each; the detailed-but-correct one takes three paragraphs—and still required a lot of simplifications. The details generally support the scientific understanding that changes in greenhouse gas concentrations can force the climate, but certainly don't do so in a straightforward manner.\nAn all-around bad idea\nIt's one thing for the Chamber to try to reopen a policy debate that has been kicked around for close to a decade and made its way all the way to the Supreme Court; it's a lobbying group, and that's more or less its job. But to suggest that a courtroom setting and media frenzy are the best way to bring some clarity to the science is ludicrous. The sort of arguments that make for good courtroom statements tend to obscure the details of science, and the specific example proposed by the Chamber clearly indicates that they do nothing for the public's understanding of science.\nOf course, it may be possible that the group really is that cynical, and this is precisely the outcome it is hoping for."}

The island's small international airport remains the only entry point for foreign aid, and planes are struggling for space.\nAccording to estimates, 50,000 to 200,000 people died in the quake and some 3 million lost their homes.\nInternational relief crews are in the area, including a Russian rescue squad, while the US is sending up to 10,000 troops to assist. Aid groups say it's now a race against time to find survivors trapped under the rubble.\nTheir efforts are being hampered by criminal gangs and looters, making it difficult to operate on the ground.\nMarcelo Sanchez, a correspondent from RT's Spanish-language sister channel who is in Haiti says there is still a lack of medical help on the island.\n“We found people trapped in debris, their families are asking for help, showing pictures of their loved ones right outside where they are buried, still alive. We could actually hear their voices, they are screaming out their names or asking for water,” Sanchez said.\nFor Haitians living abroad, their sense of helplessness is compounded by a desperate lack of information about loved ones.\nThere are over 300,000 Haitians living in Miami, the majority in the area known as Little Haiti. Some have been able to contact their families on the island but others have not been so fortunate. The lack of information has driven many to desperation.\nMarie Patricia Charles, a Haitian living in Miami, says it’s been enormously difficult to have no information about her sons.\n“I don't have the strength to suppress this pain,” Charles told RT. “If you only have two children and you don't know where they are, it's terrible. I don't have legal documents to travel to my country.”\nIn absence of any other means of help, the Haitian community in Miami is looking to God for hope.

Jot down keywords, dates, names, etc.Don't stop there!\n- Keep in mind there may be variant spellings or transliterations - especially for international subjects.\n- Consider the timeliness of your topic. Are you researching a religious event from last month, or interpretation of a 500 year old codex. Generally more recent events will likely be covered in newspapers and on-line blogs, while a little time is required before they appear in journals, and even more time for books.\n- Once you know what type of info you want, choose the right tool to find it. For books, use a catalog such as SWAN; for journal articles use an index such as JSTOR; for newspaper stories, use an index such as ProQuest News. You get the idea.\n- Consider the source.

{"text": "The weather wizards at Accuweather have peered deep into their computer models and databases and returned with a forecast for the 2013-2014 winter. Overall verdict: Winter is coming, but only somewhat reluctantly for much of the U.S.\nAccuweather long-range forecaster Paul Pastelok says the East Coast’s Indian summer isn’t going to last, but the Atlantic isn't going to experience a full-tilt winter right away.\n“It’s a slow start to the winter season to the East,” Pastelok said in a phone interview. “It’s gonna feel like fall going into next week and into late October. We’re not really getting into the deep cold yet.”\nThe first half of winter will probably be light on snow, with a possible cold snap and snowstorm in late November. Starting in January, temperatures will drop and there should be more snow, though totals will probably remain below last winter’s.\nWhat do we have to thank for the reprieve? The high-pressure systems developing over Western Canada, it turns out.\n“This time of year, we forecasters like to look at what is happening at the source of these highs: Is it cold, or only moderately cold?” Pastelok says. “If you don’t have that snowpack in western and northwestern Canada, those air masses can fizzle out.” And at the moment, he says, there isn’t that much snow below those highs.\nIn the Southeast, Pastelok and Accuweather are predicting warm, wet weather, with the possibility of record-breaking average highs in the Tennessee Valley. Flooding might be a threat in December and February.\nThe brunt of winter’s wrath will likely fall on the Midwest and the Rockies, where residents should probably start breaking out the snow shovels. The Northwest will probably also be dealing with some wild temperature contrasts, with coastal areas having a warmer than average winter, and inland states like Montana and Wyoming slated for a colder season than normal.\nIn the West, Pastelok and colleagues expect heavy rain to hit California from December to January. That should come as a relief to the Golden State, which has been undergoing moderate to extreme drought conditions for more than two years.\nIt has also been a relatively weak year for tropical storms in the Atlantic; this season has seen just two named storms that reached hurricane status. Hurricanes Humberto and Ingrid brought some heavy rain and squalls to Cape Verde and Mexico, respectively, but did not cause major damage. Pastelok attributes the relatively weak hurricane season thus far to some lingering dry air south of the Azores in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. The dry air isn’t conducive to long-lasting tropical storm systems, he says.\nWeather forecasters are at the mercy of even crueler, more capricious gods than atmospheric forces: the federal government. Pastelok notes that many resources that meteorologists rely upon, like databases of historical weather data, are inaccessible or not updating during the government shutdown.\n“I know a lot of forecasters are frustrated by this whole deal,” he says. There’s also those federally employed meteorologists at the National Weather Service that are still required to report to work. “A lot of these people are working for free.”"}

The company has introduced its very own open-source 3D printer and 3D printing software, Spark, which may change the way the world 3D prints.\nAutodesk made the announcement in May, but its strategy isn't what you think it is. Instead of trying to become the leading manufacturer of 3D printers and having to compete with popular brands like Makerbot, Autodesk is seeking to work alongside popular manufacturers, developers, and innovators by bringing easy-to-use, streamlined, open-source 3D printing software to the market.

The software enhances the maker's control over how a design is printed, and it give a more accurate look at how the final product will look before printing (a huge benefit for manufacturers that rely on 3D printing for quick, functional prototypes). The software is compatible with a wide range of printing filaments and is expected to make the 3D printing process so streamlined that a novice can do it.\nSince the software is open-source, Autodesk is asking developers to join it in recreating how we 3D print. Developers are welcome to customize the software and share their updates with the world. Autodesk is comparing this approach to Google's rollout of the Android OS. At one point, Google did sell its own mobile hardware, but its real goal was immersion of its software into the market. Today, almost no one uses Google hardware, but Android is the most popular mobile OS in the world. Autodesk is seeking to do the same with Spark -- accompanied (of course) by its very own 3D printer.\nThe printer is being released as an example of what Spark can really do, but it will retail at a hefty $5,000 and is expected to target mid-level manufacturers and small businesses. This community has the highest demand for a reliable 3D printer to make functional prototypes, and what better way to enter the market than with a one-stop printer to meet all their needs? Autodesk says it does not expect the printer to become the most popular. It is seeking total domination of the 3D printing software scene. Thus, the printer is really being developed as a prototype to show the community how Spark will change the 3D printing experience. The unit looks similar to a fancy coffee machine. Who knows? Maybe one day 3D printers will produce lattes, too.\nThis is the first time a company of this size has entered the open-source arena, and the 3D printing industry is at an interesting stage. It is most widely used by manufacturers to create a small batch of prototype designs, though manufacturers refer to the process as additive manufacturing. Sure, 3D printers have made medical aids, guns, candy, and electronics, but most consumers don't use them in their daily lives. Autodesk is asking, \"Why not?\"\nThe future is bright for 3D printing. Autodesk is initially targeting manufacturers, but our bet is that it will want in on the consumer market, too. Also, 3D printing has not really penetrated the engineering and design communities yet, and if Autodesk is backing the technology, that's likely to change -- and fast. But the process isn't without its challenges.\nAutodesk is a software company. It doesn't have much history in hardware manufacturing and delivery. If its end goal is to enter the consumer market, average consumers may not have the capital to develop their own Spark-compatible open-source hardware, and they likely cannot afford a $5,000 price tag for a mere \"toy.\"\nSome predict that Autodesk eventually will roll out a smaller, more affordable printer to target the consumer market. Until then, we can only wait to see how this one plays out. Both the printer and the software are expected to hit the market this year. Will it change the way we print?"}
{"text": "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005).\nIf you’re interested in how films tell stories, I think that you’re interested in several dimensions of narrative. Those include the story world (characters, settings, action), narration (how story information is parceled out as the film unrolls), and plot structure (the arrangement of parts).\nPlot structure matters because a movie’s parts, like parts of a song or a symphony, help shape our experience. Just as a “curtain line” makes us return after intermission, a cliff-hanging climax to a TV episode makes us tune in next week–or click to continue, if we’re binge-watching. Accordingly, storytellers reflect on how to chop up and lay out sections of their plots. Novelists fret over chapter divisions, TV writers massage their scripts to allow for commercial breaks, and playwrights map action into acts.\nThe idea of act-structure has passed into commercial screenwriting as well. Just when that happened is hard to say, but certainly by the 1980s scriptwriters consciously broke their screenplays into big chunks. That trend was largely the result of Syd Field’s 1979 book Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting, although some of his points had been anticipated in Constance Nash and Virginia Oakley’s Screenwriter’s Handbook (1974). From these books came the idea that a feature film script had a three-act structure, measured by time segments (30 minutes/ 60 minutes/ 30 minutes). The prototype was a 120-minute film, with each script page running about one minute of screen time. Field fleshed the model out by noting that “plot points” at the ends of acts one and two turned the conflicts in a new direction. Although other writers argued for other templates, and Field’s model was refined (what’s the “inciting incident” in Act One?), versions of the three-act model still rule the international film industry.\nField presented his anatomy as an analysis of hit films like Chinatown and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He suggested it as a template for a successful plot. As Field’s book gained prominence, his guidelines gave production companies an heuristic for triaging submissions. Now a story analyst could simply check pages 25-35 and 55-65 for turning points, and “incorrect” scripts could be discarded immediately. (But see P.S. below.) Through a feedback cycle, the Field model became a guide to both screenwriters and industry decision-makers. Inevitably, the whole thing got mocked. The day-by-day structure of Shane Black’s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang parodies Field’s scheme, and it closes with a self-conscious epilogue. “So,” says the narrator, “that’s pretty much that….”\nTo what extent, though, was the three-act structure employed in earlier eras? Field’s original edition drew its examples from current hits, but he implied that classics would display the same underlying architecture. Kristin, in Storytelling in the New Hollywood, claimed that four parts were more common than three, and she supported her analysis with examples from films from the silent era and the classic studio years.\nBut film analysis depends on your perspective. In any movie you can find patterns different from the ones I find, and each of us can make persuasive cases. It would be valuable to know whether American screenwriters in the studio system consciously worked with an act-based model. If they did, what assumptions did they make about the length and organization of each act?\nSome poor sucker of a screenwriter\nSteven Price’s new book, A History of the Screenplay, surveys the practices of screenplay composition in America and Europe. It traces the early years of outlines and scenarios through the continuity script of the silent years, the sound screenplay, and postwar European models, up to the New Hollywood and contemporary standards. It’s a fascinating study and sure to set a benchmark in our understanding of the conventions of screenwriting. For the 1930s and 1940s in America, Steven shows that filmmakers used two formats, either the “master-scene” one or a format involving more explicit instructions about camerawork, lighting, and other aspects. But he finds little direct evidence that screenwriters of the studio era consciously applied a three-act structure.\nFor some time, I’ve held the same view. I couldn’t find any script draft broken into acts. Some veteran screenwriters admitted using a three-act model in plotting, but their testimony came long after the era. So, for instance, Philip Dunne refers to three-act organization in his 1940s screenplays, but he makes the claim in an interview published in 1986. Billy Wilder says he “wrote [Charles Boyer] out of the third act” of Hold Back the Dawn (1941), but the remark comes in an interview given decades later. There’s always the possibility that older writers, newly aware of the Fieldian template, were projecting it backward onto their work—assuring us that they conform to contemporary standards, or even asserting precedence.\nSimilarly, we can’t rely too much on secondary sources. True, screenplay manuals, from at least 1913 onward, have recommended a three-part structure, purportedy corresponding to Aristotle’s idea that a plot must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But this rests on a misunderstanding. As I’ve mentioned before, Aristotle isn’t talking of acts; ancient Greek plays didn’t have act divisions. And almost none of the manuals use the term “acts” to describe the parts.\nRichard Brooks’ novel The Producer (1951), about a weak-willed executive trying to do the right thing, offers some hints along similar lines. He mentions that a screenplay should run to 120 pages, confirming the canonical length that Field proposes. Likewise, Brooks obliquely appeals to Aristotle.\nSome poor sucker of a screenwriter has to create a beginning, a middle and an end, and all the dialogue.\nPerhaps there’s an intentional irony in the fact that Brooks’ Hollywood exposé is itself broken into three parts, labeled “The Beginning,” “The Middle,” and “The End.”\nUnlike many authors of manuals, Brooks was an established screenwriter, and we might expect his novel to refer to acts. It doesn’t. But Lewis Herman, a minor scribe with three screen credits (including Anthony Mann’s Strange Impersonation), does. His 1952 manual declares that a feature-length film is built upon “a three-act theme outline.” The context suggests that the Hollywood studios demand this as a step toward developing a full screenplay. Herman usefully illustrates the outline with a hypothetical example.\nStill, manuals or novels aren’t ironclad sources for studio practice. Better would be contemporaneous evidence from memos, story conferences, and similar unpublished documents. Claus Tieber has done extensive research into such sources and has found no discussions of three-act structure. I’ve found a few, but they’re fairly sketchy.\nOverseeing Casablanca, Hal Wallis told Michael Curtiz, “The Epsteins have agreed to deliver the film’s ‘second act’ the following day.” Darryl F. Zanuck mentioned the “last act” in correspondence about Viva Zapata! and On the Waterfront. Supposedly John F. Seitz asked Preston Sturges about the flashback structure of The Great Moment: “Why did you end the picture on the second act?” As I noted in an earlier entry, David Selznick’s papers record a story conference on Portrait of Jennie in which Jed Harris remarks: “The second act–he must get the picture back because that’s all he’ll ever have of her.” He adds that at this point the film “is about 1/3 gone.” This suggests that some practitioners thought of the parts as roughly equal in length. (Kristin’s model proposes that this was the case.)\nIt may be, of course, that three-act structure of some sort was so ingrained in studio writers’ habits that they didn’t have to discuss it explicitly. Field was addressing aspiring screenwriters who wanted inside knowledge, but as intuitive craft workers, the old contract writers wouldn’t be likely to spell out rigid rules about length and dramatic patterning.\nSince corresponding with Steven for his book, I’ve found that one screenwriter explicitly invoked three-act structure in his working notes. And I’m embarrassed not to have noticed it earlier.\nCoupling, recoupling, and Joe Breen\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham.\nNICOLAS: Marriage has its phases–its acts–like anything else. This is another act, that’s all.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, screenplay for Infidelity.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald’s Hollywood career was mostly a fiasco. Thanks to temperament, a mentally disturbed wife, bouts of breakdown and alcoholism, and an implacable industry, he worked his way down the hierarchy to unemployment. From July 1937 to his death in 1940, he earned screen credit for just one film, Three Comrades (1938). He also started, but didn’t finish, the best Hollywood novel I know, The Love of the Last Tycoon (aka The Last Tycoon). I think it spells out some features of the Hollywood aesthetic with special vividness.\nIn early 1938 Fitzgerald began a screenplay for MGM producer Hunt Stromberg (right). Given a title, Infidelity, Fitzgerald came up with a script centered on a dead marriage. What has turned happy young lovers into a polite, numb couple? An extended flashback shows that two years earlier the husband Nicolas re-met his former secretary while his wife Althea was abroad taking care of her sick mother. The secretary, Iris, spent one night at Nicolas’ luxurious home, and it’s implied that they had sex. At breakfast, Althea returned home unexpectedly and found Iris at breakfast. After this, Althea remained married to Nicolas, but simply lived with him in detached ennui.\nBack in the present, to ramp up his mood, Nicolas decides to hold a party in the country estate he had more or less abandoned. At the same time, Althea rekindles her friendship with a former suitor, Alex. She can’t arouse herself to passion, though, and Alex leaves her. As she drives more or less hysterically to the estate where the party is in full swing, Nicolas is wandering through his mansion among the shrouded furniture.\nAt this point, because of objections from the Production Code office, Stromberg halted Fitzgerald’s work on the screenplay. Aaron Latham’s biography tells us that Fitzgerald had planned to present a reconciliation, in which a photographic trick presents Althea seeing herself as Iris and thus forgives Nicolas. But this ending would suggest that the husband’s sin went unpunished. Fitzgerald suggested an alternative, but this too was rejected by Joseph Breen. He tried to redraft the script later in 1938, but the project dissolved.\nFitzgerald had systematically studied Hollywood releases, even filing plot synopses on index cards. Accordingly, the Infidelity screenplay we have shows an awareness of 1930s storytelling conventions: montage sequences, wordless scenes, and revealing visual detail. We learn that Nicolas’ ardor is cooling when we notice that he has stopped opening Althea’s letters. Fitzgerald’s acquaintance with current trends led him to a thumbnail characterization of Althea’s friend Alex:\nHe is the type played by Ralph Bellamy in The Awful Truth–handsome, attractive, worthy, thoroughly admirable, but somehow too heavy in manner to grip the sympathy of an audience if playing opposite a man of charm.\nOccasionally, voice-over dialogue in the present is matched with images in the past, in the manner of Sturges’ “narratage” in The Power and the Glory. (See our entry here.) And the large-scale flashback structure, leaving a key action in the present suspended for nearly an hour, anticipates a mode of construction that would be common in the 1940s.\nDespite its up-to-date air, the plot of Infidelity creaks a bit. It relies on a great many coincidences and introduces rather late a major menace, a sinister surgeon who seems slated to play the disruptive role of George Wilson in Gatsby. But what’s of special interest to us is a schedule of work that Fitzgerald sent to Stromberg during the planning stages.\nFitzgerald groups his scenes into clusters, and alongside each one he notes a date on which he expects to complete it. Since each scene usually runs only a couple of pages, the groupings present a feasible day-by-day timetable. These clusters of scenes are gathered into eight “sequences,” labeled with Roman numerals. In the 1930s, a “sequence” meant, according to screenwriter Frances Marion, “a series of scenes in which the action is continuous without any break in time.” Each of Infidelity‘s sequences presents a unified phase of the action and is more or less continuous in time, although there are some ellipses as well.\nHere’s the news: Fitzgerald’s timetable assembles the sequences into acts. Sequences I through IV are labeled “FIRST ACT 45 pages.” Sequences V through VIII are labeled “SECOND ACT 50 pages.” Sequence VIII is continued to form “THIRD ACT 25 pages.”\nThe first act establishes the loveless marriage and launches the flashback. While Althea is away, Nicolas re-encounters Iris. Meanwhile, as Althea and her mother are on their way home, they conveniently run into her old beau Alex. Their departure for the United States ends this setup. In the screenplay Fitzgerald has typed: “The First Act may be said to end here.”\nThe second act develops the conflict to a point of crisis. Althea returns a week early to find Iris at breakfast with Nicolas. She resigns herself to a loveless union. Back in the present, he plans the party and at the instigation of Althea’s mother Alex starts to woo her. But he abandons Althea, and by chance she’s found by Dr. Borden, whom she starts kissing. In the notes for Sequence VIII, Fitzgerald cryptically ends the act on an alternation between the couples:\nCUT TO husband and back to old beau [Alex]\n[Alethea] with beau [Alex]\nCrisis with beau and switch [to the surgeon, Dr. Borden?]\nCUT TO husband\nAfter presenting this alternation in scenes, the manuscript concludes:\nFull shot of a bedroom, large and luxurious like everything else in this house. Soft lighting, everything covered with cloth or canvas.\nNicolas Gilbert is standing in the middle of the floor.\nClose shot of Nicolas.\nThis is presumably the end of the passage labeled “CUT TO husband.” In the Stromberg schedule, this last portion marks the end of Act Two. Act Three isn’t in the canonical version of the screenplay.\nA couple of final points about the structure. Although the screenplay is estimated at 120 pages, its proportions don’t conform to the Field paradigm. At 25 pages or minutes, the third act is short. This is a characteristic of both modern and older Hollywood climax sections. But Act One was projected to be very long at 45 pages, and Act Two approximates it at 50. Fitzgerald’s layout is perhaps more characteristic of a stage play, which can afford a longish exposition and equivalent second act. In the script version we have, both acts run equivalent page lengths.\nFitzgerald may have expected some trimming and compression at later stages. In The Producer, Brooks’ protagonist notes that a 120-page script would usually be cut down to 90 minutes because exhibitors wanted films at about that length. It’s true that few films of the studio era run to two hours.\nSet aside brute measurements. What, in Infidelity, makes an act a coherent unit? Not a specific span of time. Act One breaks off partway through the flashback, and Act Two ends before the evening party does. The first act ends when we know a crisis is coming: Althea is returning home early and hasn’t told Nicolas, whom we’ve seen flirting with Iris. Act Two ends at another high point. Nicolas confronts the emptiness of his life without his wife, and nearby Althea is heedlessly making love to a stranger with dubious designs. We could easily imagine the script as a stage play, with a curtain ringing down on each of these teasing situations.\nIn sum, we have one clear-cut case of a studio screenwriter laying out his plot in three acts. We can’t generalize from a single instance, of course, and we would need many more pieces of evidence to consider this a widespread writing strategy. Perhaps Fitzgerald isn’t typical. Did his relative inexperience as a screenwriter make him rely on a theatrical template that others could do without? Did he employ it more as a rhetorical device to convince Stromberg that the plot was firmly constructed? Still, taken with the reminiscences of Dunne, Wilder, et al. and the sketchy mentions we have in production records, the Infidelity project suggests that some conception(s) of three-act structure were operative in the studio period.\nNeedless to say, we’ll need even more evidence before we can begin to consider whether the filmmakers’ craft practice matches the structural patterns that today’s analysts disclose in the films. The search continues!\nThe Fitzgerald outline is reproduced on pp. 161-162 of Aaron Latham, Crazy Sundays: F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood (Viking, 1971). This book is not only a stimulating account of the novelist’s Hollywood years but also a helpful view of the movie colony’s culture. My discussion relies upon the version of Infidelity published in Esquire 80, 6 (December 1973), 193-200, 290-304. It is available in a digitized version here. The original manuscripts are in the University of South Carolina library.\nPhilip Dunne’s remarks about three-act structure are in Pat McGilligan, Backstory (University of California Press, 1988), 158. Billy Wilder’s remarks come in George Stevens, ed., Conversations with the Great Moviemakers of Hollywood’s Golden Age (Knopf, 2006), 316. (In the same interview Wilder claims that Some Like It Hot has four acts.) Richard Brooks’ The Producer (Simon & Schuster, 1951) is worth reading for its almost documentary survey of the process of production at the period. Lewis Herman’s Practical Manual of Screen Playwriting for Theater and Television Films (World, 1952) is an unusually detailed guidebook.\nOn Wallis’ memo about Casablanca‘s second act, see Marshall Deutelbaum, “The Visual Design Program of Casablanca,” Post Script 9, 3 (Summer 1980), 38. For Zanuck’s comments see Memo from Darryl F. Zanuck: The Golden Years at Twentieth Century-Fox, ed. Rudy Behlmer (Grove, 1993), 173, 226. Seitz’s remark to Sturges about The Great Moment is quoted in James Curtis, Between Flops: A Biography of Preston Sturges (Harcourt, Brace, 1982), 172. There’s more discussion in our blog entry on The Great Moment.\nI take Frances Marion’s definition of “sequence” as a bundle of scenes from her How to Write and Sell Film Stories (Covici-Friede, 1937), 373. Tamar Lane offers a comparable definition in his New Technique of Screen Writing (McGraw-Hill, 1936), 123. Interestingly, Lane adds that some scenarists think of each sequence as moving toward a high point, like an act in a play; but this seems only a rough analogy, and the comparison entails that a script would have several more “acts” than three. Steven Price suggests that the “sequence” as an extended script segment emerged in the silent period and hung on in some sound screenplays; see A History of the Screenplay, especially 63, 115-116, and 153-157. At the same time, “sequence” could refer to a single brief segment, as in “action sequence” or “montage sequence.”\nThanks to Steven Price and Claus Tieber for correspondence about act structure. Claus has a relevant case study of Grand Hotel, “‘A Story Is Not a Story But a Conference’: Story Conferences and the Classical Studio System,” in Journal of Screenwriting vol. 5, no. 2 (2014): 225-237. More generally, I’m grateful to researchers at the Screenwriting Research Network for what I’ve learned from their conferences in Brussels in 2011 and in Madison in 2013.\nOther entries on this site have considered act structure. Kristin explains her model, based on goal formulation and injections of new information. She expands on this as it affects character subjectivity and point of view. I illustrate her model with reference to what is supposedly the most wayward and narratively fragmented modern genre, the action picture. I offer some general reflections on how the four-part structure informs not only current films but best-selling novels. For a more general discussion of the dimensions of film narrative, you can download this chapter from my Poetics of Cinema. Also, too: there’s the precept that form follows format. Finally, I consider modern trends in screenplay construction, including act structure, in The Way Hollywood Tells It.\nAfter a while you see the triplicate scheme everywhere. In Case History of a Movie (1950), p. 30, Dore Schary says that Charles Schnee turned in the script of The Next Voice You Hear in thirds. Acts? I’ll have to get back to you.\nP.S. 19 May 2014: In reply to this post, Greg Beal comments that my discussion of rejecting screenplays based on Field’s plot points is inaccurate.\nMy claim was, I now think, an overstatement. I should not have suggested that the absence of canonical plot points would be sufficient to doom a screenplay. Naturally, I realize that the analyst would still be obliged to write fuller coverage. I meant simply that the Field template could set up expectations that the script wasn’t written to standard. Other factors would surely be taken into account in a final decision. The larger point, that three-act structure along Field’s lines shapes analysts’ judgment, remains to be determined.\nMy most concrete evidence for the saliency of the three-act, plot-point model in this production context comes from two manuals by story analysts. T. L. Katahin’s Reading for a Living: How to Be a Professional Story Analyst for Film and Television (Blue Arrow, 1990) recommends that analysts look for three acts, including a ten-page initial setup followed by a development and two further acts that forward the protagonist’s goals. But Katahin doesn’t propose exact page counts for further twists.\nMore specific is Jennifer Lerch’s 500 Ways to Beat the Hollywood Script Reader: Writing the Screenplay the Reader Will Recommend (Simon and Schuster, 1999). In following the three-act layout, she suggests that Act One, the setup, be consummated between pages 20 and 30 (ideally consisting of two scenes 10-15 pages each). Act 2, as per Field, is said to run long, up to pages 80-90, and typically consists of four to eight sequences (each 10-15 pages or so). This act is said to lead to a point of no return, the pivot-point for Act 3.\nLerch, who was a professional story analyst for the William Morris Agency for eight years, claims, “Your script’s setup can literally make or break your project in the Hollywood Reader’s eyes, particularly at some companies that instruct readers to stop at page thirty of a script if it looks substandard. You may have a great second act and climactic sequence, but Hollywood will never see it unless you give it a savvy setup” (91). Passages like this one led me to think that the Field template weighs quite strongly in analysts’ judgment. But I’ve never supervised story analysts, so I welcome Greg’s expert comment on the matter.\nP.P.S. 20 May 2014: More information on Fitzgerald’s Infidelity screenplay and its act breaks. In a letter to Hunt Stromberg dated 22 February 1938, Fitzgerald wrote:\nThe first problem was whether, with a story which is over half told before we get up to the point at which we began, we had a solid dramatic form–in other words whether it would divide naturally into three increasingly interesting “acts” etc. The answer is yes. . . .\nThis point, the decision to sail, also marks the end of the “first act.” The “second act” will take us through the seduction, the discovery, the two year time lapse, and the return of the old sweetheart–will take us, in fact, up to the moment when Joan [later, Althea] having weathered all this, is unpredictably jolted off her balance by a stranger. This is our high point–when matters seem utterly insoluble.\nOur third act is Joan’s recoil from a situation that is menacing, both materially and morally, and her reaction toward reconciliation with her husband.\nEvidently the timetable reprinted in Crazy Sundays was prepared after this letter was sent. This letter is printed in F. Scott Fitzgerald: A Life in Letters, ed. Matthew J. Bruccoli (Scribners, 1994), 348-349.\nP.P.P.S. 30 May 2014: I always enjoy getting correspondence from readers, and I must catch up by noting some other responses I’ve received. David Cairns, whose wonderful blog Shadowplay is always worth checking on (his latest post is on Hannibal, the TV show), writes with this comment:\nHold Back the Dawn (1941)."}

Those rules, which the SEC put in place after mutual funds made outlandish claims about their investment returns a generation ago, are no longer controversial.\nThis time, the SEC, under intense political pressure and facing a heavy workload in the wake of the financial crisis, has been pressed to move quickly. One lawmaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), wrote a letter in August accusing the regulator of “abdicating [its] responsibility to follow the law” for failing to act soon enough. Now the agency appears poised to sweep aside old restrictions without writing new ones. “It would have required massive rule making,” says securities lawyer Alexandra Alberstadt. “They didn’t have the time.”\nExperts say even without special rules, hedge funds won’t have an entirely free hand. They will still be subject to a separate set of existing rules aimed at investment advisers. These prohibit gimmicks like celebrity endorsements and also aim to prohibit monkeying with claims about performance, although they don’t offer specific mandates on how to present certain numbers. “They’re more broadly written,” says securities lawyer Nora Jordan."}

Overall vibration measurements, usually expressed as the RMS value (except for displacement where peak-peak values apply), form the basis of condition monitoring measurements and trending, but have limited value for analysis. rms value = 0.707 X peak value peak value = 1.414 X rms value rms value = 1.11 average value peak value = 1.57 X average value average value = 0.637 X peak value peak to peak = 2 X peak value average value = 0.90 X rms value crest factor = peak value ÷ rms value Random Vibration Acceleration, Acceleration Density and Displacement Relationships RMS value is defined as the square root of means of squares of instantaneous values. Understanding vibration analysis starts with understanding the simple mass-spring-damper model shown in Figure 1, where m is the mass, k is the spring constant, c is the damping coefficient, x represents the displacement from equilibrium and f defines the force acting on the mass as a function of time.It also helps to understand some simple equations (Table 1) that describe the â¦ ... and is only valid if the time is large enough that the transient term can be neglected. You may find a whole-body vibration machine at a local gym, or you can buy one for home use."}
{"text": "And its effect on the human civilisation.\nNote that the keyword here is “Ramble.” I have no expertise in this field except my own musings and thoughts.\nNow that that’s out of the way, I have to ask: Have you ever thought of what would happen to the human civilisation if it had not discovered coffee? Think about it.\nThis one beverage, together with its “calming” counterpart, tea, have been a staple of many a daily brew for billions around the world. In the East, tea is considered an art form. In the West, tea is revered and coffee indulged.\nWithout sugar and milk, both are generally bitter, with coffee being the more bitter of the two. Among the Chinese, there is a saying that a tea is of better quality the more bitter it is. This makes sense when you consider that the Chinese believe the more bitter the medicine, the better.\nAs for coffee, if the old stories are to be believed, it was discovered by a goatherd who noticed his goats were more energetic after eating the fruits of a certain plant. He tried it for himself and it was then that humanity discovered coffee.\nI wonder, was that really a good thing? Did it really happen that way or are we missing certain information, because coffee in its bean state is quite bitter, and humankind evolved from our not eating bitter things because they were often poison.\nThis of course, would explain why some people cannot stand the taste of coffee even if they love the aroma.\nCoffee and tea have been said to increase alertness and increase productivity because they give us an energy boost and make us more aware. Getting high or hyper after taking a cup of coffee is not unusual. The more extreme ones are often very fidgety and high-strung after just a cuppa.\nBut is all this energy really good for us?\nIn this day and age, we need the energy boost coffee gives us because it keeps us more alert and enables us to do more things with the time that’s been given to us. However, we keep finding more things to fill up that extra time because we don’t want to waste it, to the point that many become pointless and trapped in this never-ending cycle.\nDo I blame coffee?\nCertainly, though it’s not the only thing to blame. But it’s the idea that we can, and should do more things with the extra energy and time we now have that we keep filling it with meaningless activities and objects. There’s no longer a “let’s just relax for the sake of relaxing” anymore. No real downtime.\nCoffee isn’t the cause, but it’s a contributor. Yet for coffee addicts like me, it’s essential because it gives us the wakeup call and boost we need to get started in the morning. So what can we do?\nFind a space/time each day, EVERY DAY, without fail, to just simply BE. Relax, shut out distractions, and just let yourself BE. Be inactive, and let your brain process/analyse what’s happen.\nYou’ll be surprised."}

{"text": "BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — State officials are asking a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit challenging North Dakota’s constitutional prohibition on same-sex marriage, despite a wave of court decisions striking down bans in other states.\nThe state attorney general’s office filed the motion late Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Fargo. North Dakota Solicitor General Doug Bahr argues in court documents that states have the right to define and regulate marriage.\n“Nothing in the United States Constitution prevents the people of North Dakota from defining marriage as the legal union between a man and a woman,” Bahr wrote in his 50-page response.\nNorth Dakota voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage 10 years ago. The ballot received 73 percent approval.\n“The people of North Dakota, through the deliberative political process, retain the traditional understanding of marriage as the union between a man and a woman,” Bahr wrote.\nSimilar cases are being heard in courtrooms around the country, and gay marriage bans have already been struck down in several other states, including on Tuesday in deeply conservative Kentucky. The fight to legalize gay marriage began in earnest after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last year. Since then, gay rights advocates have won 18 cases in federal and state courts.\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem on Wednesday said his office is duty bound to defend the ban, despite what appears to be a growing national tide in support of gay marriage.\n“It is the constitutional duty of the attorney general to represent the state when it is sued,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n“Only the Supreme Court can determine whether North Dakota’s enactment is constitutional or not,” he said.\nNorth Dakota is the last state with a gay marriage ban to be sued by same-sex couples. The complaint, filed last month by Minneapolis attorney Josh Newville on behalf of seven couples, seeks a declaration that the ban is unconstitutional and asks that the state be forced to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize gay marriages from other states. The lawsuit claims violations on three issues that are guaranteed in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution: equal protection, due process and right to travel.\nNewville told the AP Wednesday that he’s not surprised the state is defending the ban.\n“It seems to me the defense of these bans has become more of a political thing at this point than (having) any legitimate legal basis,” he said.\nA second lawsuit challenging North Dakota’s ban has since been filed in federal court by a Fargo couple legally married in Minnesota.\nBahr argues that the U.S. Constitution doesn’t require North Dakota to recognize legal same-sex marriages in other states.\n“The fact North Dakota’s marriage laws are different from the marriage laws of some other states does not establish a viable claim that the challenged provisions violate the right to interstate travel,” he wrote."}

With several Final Four appearances and a few championship game appearances, Michigan has had plenty of time in the spotlight and established themselves as a significant program.\nMichigan won their championship back in 1989. They entered the NCAA Tournament as a #3 seed and reached the championship game by running a gauntlet that included #14 seed Xavier, #11 seed South Alabama, #2 seed North Carolina, #5 seed Virginia, and #1 seed Illinois. The championship game was played on April 3 in Seattle against the #3 seed Seton Hall Pirates. The game went to OT and Michigan won 80-79. Glen Rice set an NCAA Tournament record by scoring 184 points during the NCAA Tournament and he was named the MVP of the 1989 NCAA Tournament.\nAfter 1998, the Wolverines struggled and didn’t make another NCAA Tournament appearance until 2009 (however Michigan did win the National Invitation Tournament in 2004.) Since returning 2009, Michigan has made the NCAA Tournament 5 times in the last 6 years. Their most successful tournament during this period came in 2013 when they received an at-large bid as a #4 seed. After breezing past South Dakota State and VCU in their first two games, the Wolverines took the #1 seed Kansas Jayhawks to OT in the Sweet Sixteen and won 87-85. Michigan beat the #3 seed Florida Gators by a 20-point margin in the Elite Eight and edged out Syracuse in the Final Four to make it to the championship game.

{"text": "Recent reports have some good news for motorcyclists in the Los Angeles area. Specifically, the number of motorcyclists who get hurt or die on the roads across the country has been on a steady decline over the last decade or so.\nFor example, in 2007, there were 5,174 fatalities, but there were almost 1.5 million fewer motorcycles registered for road use as well. The fatality rate for every 100,000 registered vehicles was just a hair over 72.\nIn 2016, the number of deaths was 5,286, but the fatality rate per 100,000 bikes was just under 61. What this implies is that, overall, a motorcyclist is less likely to get killed in a motorcycle accident should they choose to ride on California’s roads or the other roads of this country.\nThe injury rate has also declined. In 2007, 103,000 motorcyclists got hurt, meaning there were 1,443 injuries for every 100,000 registered motorcyclists. In 2015, the last year injury statistics were available, there were only 88,000 injuries that were significant enough to get reported. This translated into an injury rate of 1,028 per 100,000 motorcycles.\nAlthough this is encouraging news, there is still a lot of room for improvement in the area of motorcycle safety. For one, judging by the statistics, someone who gets on a motorcycle has greater than a one in 100 chance of getting significantly hurt in an accident. This means riding a motorcycle is still risky, especially when compared to traveling in a car.\nWhile some of this risk is just the nature of riding a motorcycle, in many cases, the reason motorcyclists are more prone to getting hurt is because other motorists are not properly looking out for motorcyclists with whom they are sharing the road. In these sorts of circumstances, the injured motorcyclist or the victim’s family may be able to get compensation for their losses."}

{"text": "NASA details warm-up trend; weekend looks toastyby John Nelander\nIt’s official now – the decade 2000-2009 was the warmest on record, and 2009 was tied as the second-warmest despite the rather cool, clammy weather last year in North America. That’s according to a NASA report released yesterday.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, 2009 was the warmest ever, which offset temperatures in the United States.\n“The contiguous 48 states cover only 1.5 percent of the world area, so the United States’ temperature does not affect the global temperature much,” said\nJames Hansen, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York Hansen.\nIt’s true that these these records only go back to 1880, a mere blink of an eye in the wide scope of natural history. However, NASA scientists emphasize that the warm up since then has not been interrupted by the decade we just completed. That’s “a popular perception,” Hansen said.\nThere has been “a clear warming trend” since 1880, although there was a “leveling off” of that trend in the 1940s through the 1970s, researchers said. Average temperatures have increased about 1.5 degrees from 1880.\nLa Nina, the cool Pacific water phenomenon, helped make 2008 the coolest of the decade, but the difference was only slight.\n* * * * *\nAnd speaking of warm weather, South Florida is in the midst of a winter-style weekend heat wave. People who picked this time to take a break from the gloomy North have hit the weather lotto.\nWe’re not quite in record territory, though.\nYesterday’s high of 81 at Palm Beach International Airport was short of the record 86 degree high mark for the date. Today’s expected high of 82 would be 6 degrees off the record, and Saturday’s forecast of 79 would be no competition for the 1973 mark of 87.\nThe current forecast by the National Weather Service for Sunday, though – a high of 83 degrees – would be just 2 degrees shy of the 1965 record of 85. So, stay tuned.\nThe long-term forecast, through Feb. 5, is for fairly seasonable temperatures. The normal high for West Palm Beach, by the way, edges up 1 degree to 76, one week from today."}
{"text": "EU Free Trade Agreements With India And Canada Grind To A Halt\nfrom the biting-off-more-than-you-can-chew dept\nTechdirt has been covering the free trade agreement being negotiated between India and the EU for a while now -- that is, as well as anyone can report on something that is being conducted behind closed doors. Despite or maybe even because of that secrecy, one issue in particular has raised concerns: that India's crucial role as supplier of low-cost generics to the world's poor might be under threat. Against that background, this report on the Live Mint site comes as something of a surprise:\nEuropean commissioner for health and consumer policy Antonio Borg on Friday said the proposed trade agreement with India won't impose data exclusivity, patent extensions or linkages, in a bid to deflect criticism over the purported stance of the European Union.\nOf course, given the secrecy, we still don't know what exactly the EU is now asking for, or what India is offering here. But what is significant is that the European Commissioner has tacitly acknowledged the impact of criticism from groups concerned about the supply of generics. That's an important signal for the future, since it will doubtless encourage more groups to speak up. As to why this major concession is being made at this stage, another story in Live Mint gives us a clue:\nPatient groups and other organizations have protested against the planned free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the EU on the grounds that it will lead to stricter patent laws, delaying the entry of generic drugs into the market and raising prices.\nIndia and European Union (EU) will hold a crucial meeting on the proposed free trade agreement (FTA) on Monday in Brussels to iron out the impediments in concluding of the bilateral pact.\nPerhaps the EU has dropped its demands on strengthening drug patents in an attempt to conclude the deal quickly. But that second story was published on 14 April, and since then there has been no word of any breakthroughs in the talks, which suggests that there weren't any. As the Live Mint article notes, that means that India is starting to enter \"election mode\", when FTA negotiations will take a back seat as politicians concentrate their time and energy on local matters.\nThe meeting which is also seen as a last ditch effort to resolve the differences before India gets into the election mode where the manoeuvring of decisions regarding the pact will become difficult.\nMeanwhile, signals are emerging that another major EU free trade deal, the one with Canada, is also going nowhere:\nTalks to wrap up a multi-billion-dollar free trade deal between Canada and Europe have stalled, diplomats said, raising concerns the agreement could be put on hold as Brussels switches its attention to a much bigger pact with the United States.\nAs that notes, the problem here is the imminent TAFTA/TTIP negotiations, which are starting to occupy people's attention in Europe. Clearly, there are just too many free trade agreements trying to do too much. Which one will be the next to fail?"}

It is a severe, often fatal disease. Sporadic cases and outbreaks of Ebola have been reported throughout Africa. No cases of human illness have ever been diagnosed or spread within the U.S.\nEbola is NOT readily transmitted through the air from person to person like the flu or common cold. Rather, it is transmitted by contact with the blood and other body fluids (such as vomit, urine and stool) of an ill person. So it's unlikely that someone would catch Ebola from simply being on the same plane or in the same public space with someone who was affected.\nThe countries in Africa struggling with Ebola have limited resources and a lack of modern medical care or facilities. This is one of the main reasons health care workers are having difficulty getting the outbreak under control.\nIf someone with Ebola came to the U.S., it is unlikely it would turn into an outbreak like in West Africa. That is because the U.S. has a strong health-care infrastructure.\nModern hospitals use procedures to prevent the disease from spreading, and public health officials would work to identify those at risk of infection to prevent them from spreading it to other people.\nThe Virginia Department of Health has a plan in place to work with its partners in the event a suspected case of Ebola is reported in the state.\nStill, Ebola is serious and health officials are working with health care providers to make sure that travelers returning to the U.S. who could possibly have the virus are quickly identified, and that disease control measures are quickly put into place.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people not to travel to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, if at all possible.\nMore information: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/\nNational Breastfeeding Awareness Month\nBreastfeeding: A Winning Goal for Life!\nInfant feeding is one of the most important decisions a family can make.

Determine what should be replaced and/or how current furniture could be reconfigured to improve storage conditions. Have students research furniture types and prices, and draw up a floor plan for rearranging/replacing furniture.\n- Prepare a presentation on preservation basics and preservation activities to be presented to the Board of Trustees at the student’s workplace or a local institution of interest.\n- Ask each student to visit two separate locations that have archival materials on exhibit and evaluate them. Compare and contrast the two spaces and the exhibit techniques from the perspective of preservation.\nSuggested Term Projects\n- Students (alone or in a group) could use the information gained from the assigned readings and lecture on collections care to design a 60-minute lesson plan for a workshop in care and handling of library/archival materials for the staff and public of different library/archival settings, such as academic, public, school, historical society, and the like. Ask each person or group to present a lesson plan to the entire class.\n- Visit a museum, archives, or library exhibition and write down preservation-related observations about the exhibit. The student should sketch a floor plan of the exhibit and note the following:\n- Emergency exits\n- Smoke alarms\n- Fire extinguishers\n- Monitoring devices for environmental conditions\n- Security devices\n- Mounting and display of objects\n- Other items of interest\nHave the student write a paper describing his or her experience in visiting the library, archives, or museum exhibition and discuss the following questions:\nHow can an institution exhibit its materials and provide a safe haven for them while making them available to the public? Will achieving one aim be at the expense of the other? How did the institution visited address these issues? What did it do right? What could be improved? If your library or archives were asked to contribute some of your rare holdings to an exhibit, what would be some of your concerns?"}

{"text": "The Hague is the actual seat of government, but, somewhat anomalously, not the official capital of the Netherlands, a role set aside by the Dutch constitution for Amsterdam. The Hague is the home of the Eerste Kamer (first chamber) and the Tweede Kamer (second chamber), respectively the upper and lower houses forming the \"Staten Generaal\" (literally the \"Estates-General\"). Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands lives and works in The Hague. All foreign embassies and government ministries are located in the city, as well as the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (The Supreme Court), the Raad van State (Council of State) and many lobbying organisations, including the Association of Netherlands Municipalities.\nThe Hague was founded in 1248 by William II, Count of Holland and Rex Romanorum, who was supposed to become Holy Roman Emperor. He started the construction of a castle in a forest near the sea in Holland, where he intended to live after his coronation. He died in battle before he could be crowned. His castle was not finished, but parts of it remain and are now called the Ridderzaal (Knights' Hall). It is still in use for political events, such as the annual speech from the throne by the monarch.\nLater, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their administrative centre. 'Des Graven Hage' literally means \"the count's hedge\" or \"the count's private enclosure\". The powerful cities of Holland, like Leiden, Delft, and Dordrecht, struck a compromise to choose the then small and unimportant village of The Hague as their administrative centre. This policy was never changed, and The Hague is to this day the center of government but not the official capital.\nTo keep The Hague small, it was not allowed city rights or allowed to build city walls. When city walls were finally allowed in the 1500s, the population decided to use the money to build a city hall instead of city walls. This proved disastrous during the Eighty Years' War, as it allowed Spanish troops easily to occupy the town.\nThe Hague was finally named a city by the French occupation force in 1806, centuries after other Dutch cities had received similar rights. All this has led to the urban legend that The Hague is not a city but a village.\nThe Binnenhof (Dutch, lit. \"inner court\"), is a collection of buildings in The Hague. It has been the location of meetings of the Staten-Generaal (the Dutch parliament) since 1446, and has been the centre of Dutch politics for centuries.\nThe grounds on which the Binnenhof now stands was purchased by Count Floris IV of Holland in 1229, where he built his mansion. More buildings were constructed around the court, several of which are well known in their own right, such as the Ridderzaal (great hall; literally Knight's Hall), where the queen holds her annual speech. One of the towers, simply known as het Torentje has been the working space of the Prime minister of the Netherlands since 1982. The Binnenhof was also the site where statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was executed in 1619.\nThe Peace Palace (\"Vredespaleis\" in Dutch), situated in The Hague, Netherlands, is often called the seat of international law because it houses the International Court of Justice (which is the principal judicial body of the United Nations), the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Hague Academy of International Law, and the extensive Peace Palace Library. In addition to hosting these judicial functions, the Palace is also a regular venue for special events in international policy and law.\nNoordeinde Palace is one of the four official palaces of the Dutch royal family. Located in The Hague in the province of South Holland, it has been used as the \"working palace\" for Queen Beatrix since 1984. The palace originally started as a medieval farmhouse, which was converted into a spacious residence by the steward of the States of Holland, Willem van de Goudt in 1533. The original farmhouse's cellars can still be seen in the palace basement."}
{"text": "As long as a masonry chimney is constructed properly, it should last for a very long time without showing any signs of wear and tear. But over the years, the weather can start to take a big toll on a masonry chimney and cause it to crumble. You should make sure that you have masonry repairs done to your chimney and any other masonry work you might have on your property as soon as you can. Take a look at a few of the reasons why these repairs are so important.\nStops masonry from falling apart\nOver time, it’s not uncommon for the bricks and mortar joints in masonry to start to fall apart on you. They can both weaken, especially when they’re exposed to rain, snow, and other forms of precipitation. The materials used to create masonry chimneys and walls are porous and can absorb water and lose some of their strength. Masonry repairs will reverse this trend and help your masonry to stay strong for the foreseeable future.\nProtects the structural integrity of masonry\nIf a few bricks and a couple mortar joints weaken, it’s probably not going to be the end of the world for your masonry chimney or wall. It’ll continue standing strong as a whole, even as some small areas get weaker. But if you don’t do anything about this problem, it can get worse over the months and years that you live in your home. And eventually, there’s a chance that your masonry chimney or wall could come crashing down. It won’t have the structural integrity it needs to stay put any longer. Masonry repairs can help your masonry steer clear of this fate.\nEnsures masonry always looks its absolute best\nYour masonry chimney or wall might not be the first thing people see when they pull up in front of your home. But if it’s in bad shape, it is going to serve as an eyesore. You can keep your masonry looking its best by doing the necessary repairs to it. It’ll help your entire home look better when you take the time to maintain your masonry."}

Doctors are looking for new therapies without the side effects of current treatments.\nIn one of the first human studies on resveratrol, 57 participants with type 2 diabetes continued taking standard oral glucose control drugs with or without 250 mg of resveratrol per day. After six months, while there were no changes for placebo, those taking resveratrol saw a significant decrease in body weight, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, improved kidney function, and beneficial increases in circulating antioxidant enzymes. Also, resveratrol tended to decrease long-term fasting glucose levels."}

{"text": "For the past few years getting a real estate loan has been fairly easy. The reason has little to do with interest rates or credit reports; instead investors who provide the cash used for mortgages have been looking at risk versus reward. For them the question has been: Would you accept a few additional foreclosures among thousands of loans if your overall portfolio produced a better rate of return?\nThe result, according to the Federal Reserve, is that mortgage applicants “who are less creditworthy or who are unwilling or unable to document their creditworthiness or income are increasingly less likely to be turned down for a loan; rather, they are offered credit at higher prices.”\nIn other words, woeful credit is no longer a barrier to getting a mortgage. Even borrowers with terrible credit are able to get financing if only they’re willing to make bigger payments.\n“The idea of risk-based pricing in real estate really started with appraisals,” says James J. Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac, the largest marketplace for foreclosure properties. “It used to be that every mortgage required an appraisal if one had not been done during the past six months. But a few years ago, a new idea emerged: Why have an appraisal when the value of most homes was pretty well known?”\nLenders, after all, have extensive records regarding the loans they’ve made. In many states, sale and value information is freely available from assessment and property tax offices. If you stick all the data in a computer and run the numbers using automated valuation models (AVMs) you can get a good idea of local home values. In fact, the more valuations you run the better the system gets over time.\nWhat an AVM can tell is the statistically-indicated value of a home. However, if the valuation is wrong and the property is foreclosed, that isn’t much of a financial problem for a lender with 25,000 or 50,000 loans.\nFirst, a foreclosed property is worth something rather than nothing. There are many cases where a home is a complete loss.\nSecond, the difference between the sale price of a foreclosed property and the first-loan balance is often covered in part or in whole by insurance from either the federal government for VA and FHA loans or by private mortgage insurance (PMI) for conventional loans.\nThird, while the loss of a home to foreclosure is a life-changing event to an individual owner, in statistical terms the lender’s financial risk is off-set by thousands of loans. A foreclosure here or there will not bankrupt a lender.\nBecause the mortgage marketplace is highly competitive, lenders cannot simply charge more for all loans. Instead they compete today by micro-pricing, offering loans at different rates and terms for individual borrowers.\nFor lenders “risk-based pricing” means that each borrower is evaluated individually and then offered a loan which minutely reflects their specific credit standing. It also means that Lender Smith may well offer a different rate when compared with Lender Jones. Even though both have the same data they may each have a different level of risk acceptance. Because lenders have different views of risk and reward, borrowers with a given credit rating can routinely find different rates, terms and programs by shopping around.\nTo see how “risk-based pricing” works, imagine that the “par” interest rate for a loan is 6.5 percent — the “par” rate is the interest level without points. Some combinations of rates and credit might look like this:\n· A borrower with a sold credit score, say 720 or better, might get the 6.5 percent par rate.\n· A borrower with weaker credit and a score of 650 might pay 7.2 percent plus 2 points or perhaps 7.4 percent and no points.\n· A borrower with great credit, say someone with a score above 800, might pay 6.3 percent and no points. In effect, this borrower gets a substantial benefit for good credit.\n· The borrower with great credit and that 800 score might pay 6.5 percent — but the lender in this situation may pay some or all of the borrower’s closing costs.\nNot only can lenders adjust interest rates according to risk, they can also adjust mortgage insurance premiums.\nFor instance, in July 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5121, the gloriously-named “Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2006.” The legislation was designed to modernize the FHA loan program. A companion Senate bill, S. 3535, was introduced, but did not pass.\nIf enacted into law the legislation would eliminate the current insurance premium caps — as much as 2.3 percent upfront plus .55 percent annually — that now apply uniformly to all FHA borrowers. Instead, the legislation would allow the FHA “to raise or lower the premium to match the borrower’s risk.” The result is that FHA borrowers would pay market loan rates while FHA exposure would be reduced because riskier borrowers would pay higher insurance premiums.\nIn this situation, borrowers might qualify for a lower interest rate or bigger loan amount if they accept a higher mortgage insurance premium. Since insurance is a smaller cost than interest, this might be a good trade for many borrowers.\nTo this point risk-based pricing has given more borrowers access to a wider range of mortgages than might otherwise have been the case. However, the system is based on mathematical models and has largely functioned in a marketplace defined by rising values and relatively-low interest levels.\n“How well risk-based pricing will function in a slower market or in a market with steeper interest rates is unknown,” says RealtyTrac’s Saccacio. “We may find that the models work very well in good times but that they produce huge numbers of foreclosures when interest rates rise or home sales decline. Especially in situations that involve interest-only financing and option ARMs — loans with low monthly costs up-front and perhaps far-higher costs in the future — we may discover that risk-based pricing is more risky than anyone expected. Now is the time to refine lender models, to make them more conservative, so we can reduce potential foreclosure rates.”\nPeter G. Miller is the author of The Common-Sense Mortgage and is syndicated in more than 90 newspapers."}

{"text": "Hi: I'm looking for input from anyone who has experience assembling the MLP package on PCBs. We are experiencing solder opens after assembly, and I'm curious to see how others are processing these critters.\nThe part we are using is a Semtech SH3000 (microbuddy) It is 3mm by 3mm square with four solder contacts on each bottom side. Since there is no leads on this package, there is no standoff from the PCB. Because there is no standoff/gap under part, we do not run it down our SMT assembly lines which use water soluble solder pastes. Our customer does not want to use a no-clean assembly process for the whole PCB. I do not think that a water wash system would reliably clean the organic acids from the water soluable paste under the part. The solder connections are on the underside of the part only, and are not visable after processing. I am having difficulty X-raying the joints to verify them.\nOur assembly process for this part is as follows:\n1. Screen print solder paste on PCB(water soluble flux type) 2. Place SMT parts (except Microbuddy) 3. Reflow assembled PCB (convection reflow) 4. Clean PCBs in water wash system 5. Flux Microbuddy location with Kester TSF-6522(no-clean \"tacky\" type flux) 6. Hand place Microbuddy 7. Local reflow of solder using handheld hot air tool. (Haako 850)\nMy questions are: A. What assembly processes are others using to attach this part. B. What inspection methods are others using to verify solder connections? C. Are others using water soluble solder paste, and then water washing?"}
{"text": "South Carolina consumers complained less in 2013\nCOLUMBIA — The volume of consumer complaints filed with state regulators in South Carolina dropped significantly in 2013.\n“The decrease in complaints is attributed to the economy rebounding and a more thorough vetting process implemented by complaint analysts at the front end,” according to a news release from the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs.\nOfficials said the agency’s new online complaint system, launched in January, should make the complaint process more efficient.\nThe consumer affairs agency received more than 4,100 complaints in 2013. Figures from the previous year show the agency received 5,500 complaints. In each year, regulators won back about $1.3 million that was wrongly collected from consumers. The amounts came in the form of refunds, credit and adjustments.\nIn 2013, the largest complaint category was debt collection, at 13 percent, nearly tied with complaints against utility companies, which made up at 12.9 percent, according to the agency.\nFigures show that consumer angst toward their utilities rose last year. In 2012, utilities were the source of only 9 percent of consumer grievances.\nVehicle complaints made up 12 percent, while retail stores trailed far behind with 7 percent, and real estate sector grievances were only 5 percent of complaints last year.\nDebt collection complaints have placed atop all others since 2010.\nThe top five consumer refunds were related to debt collection businesses that targeted someone who did not possess the debt in question. The agency recovered $440,912 for consumers in that category.\nContract problems involving a mortgage resulted in the government regulators’ returning $160,000 to consumers. Additionally, regulators helped consumers get back $54,620 after a credit reporting agency processed inaccurate items on credit reports.\nProblems with lemon vehicles and new vehicles resulted in the government agency’s recovery of $30,000 for wronged consumers. The smallest recovery area was for contract conflicts over mortgages, for a total of $29,642 that was returned to consumers.\nThough complaint numbers are down in comparison to previous years, the department still mediated a similar number of refunds, credits and adjustments compared to 2012.\nConsumers may register a complaint at www.consumer.sc.gov.\nConsumers may also use the public information tool by researching complaints against businesses before deciding to patronize them.

{"text": "Eric JAMES, PhD\nAuthor of The humanitarian-military complex in Afghanistan\nWorld attention lately has been on a batch of crises; the Syria civil war, the flow of refugees into Europe and political shifts toward right-wing populism. But the dilemmas and challenges that have plagued Afghanistan linger particularly where the interaction between security and development reveal themselves. The situation will no doubt retake headlines at some point in the near future.\nAs I write this in Kabul, I’m struck by the turbulence of the last 15 years and the scars it has left. The city itself is hard to recognize from my first visit in late 2001. New buildings line the streets and traffic clog the streets during the day. The population has swelled and for several years the country had the fastest economic growth rate on the planet. Most development indicators showed vast improvement. International aid was part of the reason. At its height, hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into the country. Some was for development and humanitarian aid and some of it went directly to political-military leaders (‘warlords’) to pay for ‘stabilization.’ This second part is widely seen as a huge error. The return on these investments, the ostensible outcomes sought, have been poor.\nNow, the economic bubble has burst. European and US aid has been slashed in half and the international presence that once made for a lively night out is dried up and gone (expat hangouts are shuttered and the glossy magazine “Afghan Scene” that chronicled it all is no more). At least there’s a sardonic humor that is evident of those who endure. Those who wished the foreign presence would ‘go away’ have gotten their wish.\nAt the same time, human suffering is widespread. Access to basic services is poor (if a major medical problem arises, people have to travel to neighboring countries can get proper treatment). War has caused the number of IDPs in the country to increase to over 500,000 this year. Some risk the dangerous journey in becoming a refugee rather than stay. A dear Afghan friend, whom I’ve known now for 15 years, tells me “Young people have no hope.”\nSecurity remains a key issue. Two years after the US-led mission in Afghanistan ended and the country continues to trudge along with a small international force to assist with training and targeted military operations. Even the government admit that it controls only 258 of 407 districts, while insurgents control 33 and 116 districts are contested. The Taliban and other anti-government elements remain ever present. In the last few days, the Taliban’s spokesman announced that they would no longer attack development projects and are “committed to protecting them.” Most local observers see this change about energy resources that cross the country into Pakistan and not as a change in ethos of the group. Targeted attacks designed to spread fear, the original reason for the US-led coalition 15 years ago, continue. The Islamic State (deash, ISIS or ISIL), has gained a toe-hold in some areas particularly close to Pakistan, although this is more of a ‘re-branding’ exercise of existing groups seeking to link themselves to the military successes in Iraq and Syria.\nThe “Great Game” is used to describe the political and diplomatic confrontation that existed for most of the nineteenth century between Britain and Russia over Afghanistan. What has been happening can be seen as the “greatest of games” given the shifty nature of alliances, profiteering, extortion and payment for favors. Corruption is so rife that it stifles nearly every aspect of life.\nNot only are there strong linkages between crime, insurgency and enterprise (whether commercial, government and charity-related) but these relationships and back-channels cut across a diverse and tangled network including families and friendships. While the Western government, militaries and aid agencies have been complicit in creating this untenable situation, the local elites and powerholders have run with it. The impact has been that hard fought stability continues to be a veneer. Even the US’s Special Inspector General on Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, has admitted that “past gains are eroding.” This is no doubt an understatement. Certainly, those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable.\nIn “The humanitarian-military complex in Afghanistan”, Tim Jacoby and I examine how this situation has come to pass. We look at how the dynamics of security (particularly Western military forces) and the agencies involved in providing aid (particularly non-governmental organizations) evolved, grappled with the situation and with themselves. Based on extensive field research and in-depth analysis, we unpack issues of history, policy, ethics and effectiveness. A key issue is that aid agencies change their policies and actions depending on the context thus raising the possibility of transcending the simple “for” or “against” arguments leading to a more refined understanding of the relationship between humanitarians and the military.\nThis complex set of issues is not just important for the organizations themselves but for the right local policy prescriptions and practices. It is often noted that without security, there can be no development. It is also necessary to know what has passed to have an effective path forward. The remaining concerns and shifting political dynamics – not just in Afghanistan but its neighbors, various regional powers as well as in the West – may set the country on another episode.\n See http://sunnyinkabul.com/ and https://twitter.com/afghanonion\nDescription of The humanitarian-military complex in Afghanistan…\n…violent conflict brings together two seemingly disparate groups: humanitarians and soldiers. This mixes and convolutes agendas, blurring lines that are often perceived to be sacrosanct. Delving deeply into the history and reasons of why these two groups work in close proximity, this study provide a unique insight into the history, ethical dilemmas and policy conundrums when aid workers operate close to the military. Using Afghanistan as a case study, analytical rigour, deep primary research and “field” knowledge are combined in an exceptional contribution to this important area. This book gives scholars and practitioners alike a nuanced perspective on the challenges faced by aid workers, military personnel and decision-makers alike in countries affected by violent conflicts, hosting foreign military interventions and receiving international aid.\nSee more here: The humanitarian-military complex in Afghanistan"}

{"text": "The public gets fascinated by the monthly jobs report, but for our money, right now, you can't do better than the Durable Goods and Personal Spending numbers that came out today, in terms of getting a feel for what's going on with the economy. Everyone knows what Personal Spending is, but Durable Goods are less known: They're the products that people buy that last for a very long time. Many of those products are business purchases of machinery and equipment.\nThe reason is that both of these numbers should conceivably be in trouble if a pre-Fiscal Cliff paralysis is settling into the economy. Indeed, one of the most common economic refrains is that the Fiscal Cliff has already hit the economy (regardless of whether we \"go over it\" or not).\nFor the last couple of months, people have been talking about the capital expenditure slowdown as proof of this.\nBut today's number blow this fear out of the water.\nHere's a chart of Capital Goods Orders Excluding Defense and Aircraft/Parts. The idea is it strips the number down to real, normal, non-lumpy business investment. If there were a cliff paralysis in place, this number would be fading. And indeed analysts had expected growth of 0%. Instead it rose 2.7%.\nCouple that with the strong personal spending report, and you'll soon realize that one of the biggest fiscal cliff fears is getting destroyed."}

However, short quotations may be used if credit is given.] Follow for Works Cited and text of poem.\ns a Jesuit priest who had converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1866, Gerard Manley Hopkins was no doubt saturated with the Bible (Bergonzi 34). Although in \"Gods Grandeur\" Hopkins does not use any specific quotations from the Bible, he does employ images that evoke a variety of biblical verses and scenes, all of which lend meaning to his poem. Hopkins \"creates a powerful form of typological allusion by abstracting the essence — the defining conceit, idea, or structure — from individual scriptural types\" (Landow, \"Typological\" 1). Through its biblical imagery, the poem manages to conjure up, at various points, images of the Creation, the Fall, Christs Agony and Crucifixion, mans continuing sinfulness and rebellion, and the continuing presence and quiet work of the Holy Spirit. These images combine to assure the reader that although the world may look bleak, man may yet hope, because God, through the sacrifice of Christ and the descent of His Holy Spirit, has overcome the world.\nThe opening line of \"Gods Grandeur\" is reminiscent both of the Creation story and of some verses from the Book of Wisdom. The word \"charged\" leads one to think of a spark or light, and so thoughts of the Creation, which began with a spark of light, are not far off: \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. 1.3). Yet this \"charge\" was not a one time occurrence; \"[t]he world is charged with the grandeur of God\" (Hopkins 1). Or, in the words of Wisdom 1:7, \"The spirit of the Lord fills the world\" (Boyle 25). This line of the poem also sounds like Wisdom 17:20: \"For the whole world shone with brilliant light . . .\" Nor does the similarity end with the first part of this biblical verse. The author of Wisdom proceeds to tell us that the light \"continued its works without interruption; Over [the Egyptians] alone was spread oppressive night . . . yet they were to themselves more burdensome than the darkness\" (Wisd. 17.20-21). Here lies the essence of Hopkinss poem. In lines five through eight, he will show us the \"oppressive night\" that men bring upon themselves in their disregard for God and His creation. But he will also show us, in the final sestet of his poem, that the light will nonetheless continue to shine \"without interruption.\" God will not cease working in the world.\nIndeed, His grandeur \"will flame out, like shining from shook foil\" (Hopkins 2). The word \"flame\" is often associated with Gods grandeur. In Daniel 7:9, the prophet describes Gods throne as being like \"the fiery flame.\" In Revelation, \"the Son of God . . . hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire\" (Rev. 2.18). In Exodus, God appears \"unto [Moses] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" (Exod. 3.2; Boyle 31). After promising Samsons parents a son, the angel of the Lord \"ascended in the flame of the altar\" (Judges 13.20). It is possible, too, that this flame is meant to recall the \"cloven tongues like as of fire\" that appeared above men on the day of Pentecost, when Gods grandeur was shown through the descent of His Holy Spirit and in the speaking of tongues (Acts 2.1-4; Boyle 27-28).\nThe second half of this image is primarily a scientific one. It refers to gold leaf foil as used to measure electrical charges in Faradays famous experiment (Boyle 26). But there is also a biblical significance. Proverbs 4:18 tells us that \"the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" Just as light is reflected from gold foil, flashing out in multiplying rays, so too does the Light of God, which leads men, continue to increase. This image in one way ties into lines three and four of Hopkinss poem, in which Gods grandeur \"gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil / Crushed.\" Both images demonstrate a process of increase in Gods grandeur. Gethsemane \"means the place of the olive-press\" (Landow, \"Typological\" 6; Boyle 32). It was there that Gods grandeur \"gather[ed] to a greatness,\" for it was there that Christ wrestled with doubt and fear and, gathering His strength, finally made an irrevocable choice to glorify His Father: \"not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22.42).\nThe olive, in itself, is not particularly valuable. It can be eaten, but until it is pressed, it has no further use. Once pressed into oil, however, it was used in biblical times for cooking (1 Kings 17.12-13), lighting lamps (Exod. 27.20), anointing (Ps. 23.5), binding wounds (Luke 10.34), and in perfume (Luke 8.46). It was very valuable, and the promised land was referred to as, among other things, a \"land of oil olive\" (Deut. 8.8). This, then, is an apt metaphor for Gods grandeur as revealed through Jesus Christ. Had Christ chosen, at that point of agony in the garden, not to submit to the crucifixion, His entire life up to that point would have been (like the uncrushed olive) of little value. His teachings and His miracles would probably have been forgotten in time, and man would still have no adequate atonement for sin. But just as the olive is crushed to reveal something costly and useful, so too did Christ chose to be crushed to bring forth His priceless blood, which saves men (Landow, \"Typological\" 6).\nAccepting this role was no easy matter for Christ. Robert Boyle sees the \"main point of the [olive oil] image [as being] that something hidden, beautiful, and wonderfully powerful is revealed\" (31). But an at least equally important point is how that hidden something is revealed. Boyle believes the olive oil image refers not to \"the gathering of ooze from the cracks of a press\" but rather to gentle kneading with a hand: \"the beauty and power is hidden within the olive and can be brought out without a press at all, e.g., by the pressure of the fingers or palms\" (32). This seems unlikely, however, given that at Gethsemane, Christ was not lightly pressed as if in a palm, but was rather weighed down and crushed with great agony, sweating \"as it were great drops of blood\" and begging that, if at all possible, His cup be taken from Him (Luke 22.42-44; Boyle 32). Furthermore, it was at the oil-press that Christ, in order to purchase \"beauty and life,\" chose to submit to an even greater \"crushing\": the beams of the bark that would grind Him down as He bore His cross up the hill of Calvary, the pain that would come from being nailed through His hands and feet, and the slow suffocation that would precede His death (Landow, \"Typological\" 6).\nGeorge P. Landow acknowledges the significance of Christs suffering. He describes one of Hopkinss \"basic and generating conceit\":\n. . . higher beauty and higher victory can come forth only when something . . . is subject to greater pressure and crushed or bruised . . . true beauty, true life, true victory can only be achieved, as Christ has shown, by being bruised and crushed. (\"Allusion\" 1).\nThis conceit, Landow explains, is based upon the type of Genesis 3:15, which says: \"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.\" Christ is the one who bruises Satans head, defeating the adversary through His own bruising, His crucifixion.\nTo the casual reader, this image of the \"ooze of oil / Crushed\" may seem unnecessarily crude. It contrasts sharply with the brilliant metaphor of flame and shining. As Virginia Ellis writes, the image of \"[s]haken goldfoil,\" once properly understood, \"vividly suggest[s] both the breadth and the sudden flashing depth of Gods power\" (129-30). The word \"ooze,\" on the other hand, generally possesses a disagreeable connotation. Yet this contrast must be deliberate. For the Incarnation is, after all, a very crude thing. An omnipotent, omniscient God chose to come down from the heavenly realm and take on the form of a mere man, subjecting Himself to the limitations of humanity, in order that He might die a cruel death to save men who were \"yet sinners\" (Rom. 5.8). The brilliance of lines one and two of Hopkinss poem contrast with the crudeness of lines three and four to reveal Gods amazing condescension, which is part of His grandeur.\nGiven this awesome condescension, and given the emotional and physical pain to which Christ subjected Himself, Hopkins cries plaintively, \"Why do men then now not reck his rod?\" (4). Most likely, this reference to \"rod\" will evoke in the readers mind the image from Revelation in which Christ rules men \"with a rod of iron\" (Rev. 19.15). But a more appropriate allusion may be found in Isaiah: \"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him\" (11.1-2; emphasis added). The \"his\" of this line of the poem must grammatically refer to the \"God\" of line one. Gods rod, then, is Christ Himself. God gave up his rod, His only Son, as a sacrifice for the very men who (we will soon see) fail both to perceive and to honor Him in His creation. \"And the very blame which [Hopkins] heaps on man\" in lines five through eight of the poem \"is witness to his vivid realization that man does not need to be [behaving] as he does, that the Fall has been undone by the Second Adam\" (Boyle 37). Indeed, the rod of iron that awaits these men could become for them a rod of comfort. If they would but trust in Gods Rod, they too, like the psalmist, might say, \"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me\" (Ps. 23.4).\nBut \"[i]nstead of recognizing the authority of Gods majesty and grandeur in nature, as St. Paul says he should,\" writes Boyle, \". . . man tramples it in his contempt for and ignorance of his and its Creator\" (35-6). This is made clear in line five of the poem: \"Generations have trod, have trod, have trod.\" The image resembles Gods complaint in Ezekiel: \"Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures?\" (34.18). It is bad enough that man has disregarded the beauty of Gods creation and failed to see His grandeur in it. But man has done worse than ignore it, he has polluted it with his own sinful nature; he has brought darkness upon himself in the very midst of Gods light.\n\"And all is seared with trade,\" writes Hopkins (6). Nothing has escaped mans materialistic touch. Men, consumed by their own interests, have forgotten Jamess warning:\nGo to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is you life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. (Jas. 4.13-14)\nThis image of all being seared with trade conjures up a picture of the symbolic wicked city of Babylon, where men trade in \"gold, and silver, and precious stones . . . horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men\" (Rev. 18.12-13). Men have put their trust in the produce of their own hands, caring nothing for the soul. Indeed, they have chosen the beast over God, and have perhaps been seared not just with trade, but in order to trade, for \"no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name\" (Rev. 13.17). Yet all of mans monotonous, materialistic striving will come to nothing: \"And . . . as many as trade by sea, stood afar off . . . weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships . . . for in one hour is she made desolate\" (Rev. 17-19).\nMen, laboring to amass useless wealth, have become \"[b]leared, smeared with toil\" (Hopkins 6). This, argues Boyle, should not be taken merely as an indictment of industrialism:\nThe situation reaches far more deeply into the nature of man . . . After the Fall man . . . has to tread the world and to sweat . . . (Genesis, 3:17-19) . . . But Hopkins emphasis is on the \"all\" of \"all is seared with trade.\" And his complaint is that the soil is not cleared here and there, but it is bare. He is not here condemning man for the Fall, but for what he adds to the Fall from his own personal malice and rebellion against God . . . (36)\nThis image of bare soil pertains not just to mans destruction of nature, but to his spiritual bareness. In Christs parable of the sower, we learn that \"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it . . . And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and chocked it\" (Luke 8.5-7). Nature is the vehicle of this metaphor, but mans spirit is the tenor. The soil is bare just as mans soul is bare; he has borne no spiritual fruit. Either he has rejected Gods good news, as if trampling it beneath his feet, or he has at first received it gladly, but then been \"chocked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life\" (Luke 8.14).\nNot only is the soil \"bare now,\" but \"nor can foot feel, being shod\" (Hopkins 7-8). Again we are reminded of the scene of the burning bush, in which God tells Moses: \"put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\" (Exod. 3.5; Boyle 31; Ellis 131). We see man \"profaning with shod feet what should be holy ground, not bare soil\" (Boyle 31). In the Bible, to be barefoot is to feel. In Mosess case, the feeling is reverence. In the case of those defeated by war and lead away barefoot, the feeling is shame (Isa. 20.2-4). And in the case of David ascending the Mount of Olivet to seek Gods guidance during the rebellion of Absalom, the feeling is sorrow: \"And David . . . wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot\" (2 Samuel 15.30). But in Hopkinss poem, the men are shod, symbolizing the fact that they have become calloused, incapable of spiritual feeling. If men are to be shod with anything, they should be \"shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace\" (Eph. 6.15).\nThe picture painted in lines five through eight of \"Gods Grandeur\" leaves little apparent hope for man. But we have been forewarned in the first three lines of the poem that Gods light has not been eclipsed by mans darkness, and that His grandeur will yet \"flame out.\" Hopkins does not abandon this promise, but resumes it with full force in the final sestet of his poem. \"And for all this,\" he avows, \"nature is never spent\" (9). The word \"nature\" may be taken to apply, on three different levels, to physical nature (i.e. rocks, trees, animals, etc.), human nature (i.e. the human race), and divine nature (i.e. God).\nPhysical nature, despite mans misuse of it, has not been spent, but continues to be rejuvenated and to bare witness to its Creator. Indeed, God has promised peace in nature, vowing that \"[t]hey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain\" (Isa. 11.6-9). Likewise, human nature is never spent, \"[f]or God formed man to be imperishable; the image of his own nature he made him\" (Wisd. 2.23). And finally, divine nature is never spent — that is, God is not exhausted, and He has not given up on man. He will continue to labor, through the Holy Spirit, to bring men to repentance, helping them to become \"partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" (2 Pet. 1.4). Man has not be \"spent\"; he has not been sold to Satan. To the contrary, he has, in fact, been \"bought with a price\" (1 Cor. 6.20).\nThis price, \"Christs decent into human flesh,\" and His crucifixion, is what makes the \"freshness\" of line ten of the poem \"dearest\" (Landow, \"Typological\" 6). This \"freshness\" is probably meant to evoke and consequently to defy the finality of the image of the wanton destruction of nature in Wisdom. The word \"freshness\" is unique, being found nowhere in the Protestant Bible. But in Wisdom, men, \"thinking not aright\" and believing their lives to be short and mortal, say, \"let us . . . use the freshness of creation avidly . . . Let no meadow be free from our wantonness\" (Wisd. 2.1-9). When interpreting the poem on the level of physical nature, we should not underestimate \"[t]he anguish that Hopkins . . . felt because industrial man not only failed to respond to the forms of nature but in fact seemed dedicated to their annihilation\" (Bump 159). Hopkins wrote in one of his journals:\nThe ashtree growing in the corner of the garden was felled. It was lopped first: I heard the sound and looking out and seeing it maimed there came at that moment a great pang and I wished to die and not see the inscapes of the world destroyed any more. (Bump 159)\nYet, despite the fact that man abuses nature for his transitory pleasure, he does not have the power to destroy it altogether, for there still \"lives the dearest freshness deep down things\" (Hopkins 10).\nThe \"deep down\" things signify not only the rejuvenation of nature, but the rejuvenation of man through the presence of the Holy Spirit. Christs death, while ransoming sinners, also made it possible that the Holy Spirit might be sent into the world (John 16.7). The symbolic dove, whose image we see in lines 13-14, expresses \"the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in creatures and above all in the souls of men\" (Boyle 37). The Spirit dwells within all believers, but It will also continue Its efforts to bring unbelievers to repentance, for God is \"not willing that any should perish\" (2 Pet. 3.9). And although Christ was crushed down, emotionally and physically, He rose again, and He will also come again.\n\"Only seemingly,\" writes Ellis, \"is Gods energy fallen, crushed, debased in this world\" (128). For, even \"though the last lights off the black West went / Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward springs\" (Hopkins 11-12). Or, as 2 Samuel 23:4 prophesies, \"he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.\" Again, the vehicle of the metaphor is nature, and its rejuvenation symbolizes Christs coming into the world. This image of morning springing from darkness also draws our attention to the words of Isaiah: \"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily\" (58.8). And again:\nI will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known:I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. (Isaiah 42.16; emphasis added)\nThe continuing presence of the Holy Spirit is proof of this promise. God continues to work through the Holy Ghost, who \"over the bent / World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings\" (Hopkins 13-14). The bent (crooked) world has not been abandoned by God; it will be made straight, for it has been conquered by Him, and it is still being protected by Him.\nThe bird imagery of line fourteen is drawn from the baptism of Jesus, when \"he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him\" (Matt. 3.17; Boyle 38). This dove imagery, in turn, is meant to recall Genesis, in which the Holy Spirit apparently broods over the world: \"And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (1.2; Boyle 38). The wing imagery possess a variety of positive connotations. Wings are associated in the Bible with Gods healing (Mal. 4.2), with His protection (Ruth 2.12; Ps. 17.8, 26.7, 57.1, 61.4, 63.7, 91.4; Matt. 23.37), with the strength that He imparts to man (Isa. 40.31; Exod. 19.4), and with His conquest. This last association, though not the most obvious, is perhaps the most crucial. When God is said to \"spread His wings over\" a city, it means He has conquered it (Jer. 48.40). At the end of \"Gods Grandeur,\" God, in the person of the Holy Spirit, has spread His \"bright wings\" over the \"bent world,\" implying that He is not only protecting, healing, and strengthening it, but that, despite the seeming triumph of darkness, He has already conquered the world through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who was crushed like an olive for this very purpose.\nThe world remains charged with the grandeur of God, \"in spite of all mankind has done and is doing to pollute and pervert and tread out its radiance\" (Ellis 129). God, through the constant presence of His Holy Spirit, continues to rejuvenate physical nature as well as the human spirit; both are \"being made over anew\" (Wisd. 19.6). So, however dark and dreary this world may appear (and does appear in lines five through eight of the poem), we must not surrender hope. For as Christ exhorted, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\" (John 16.33).\nBergonzi, Bernard. Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ed. Louis Kronenberger.

{"text": "How many nuclear bombs do we need?\n\"When I became conscious, it was a dead city.\" The college students in the room are silent as Shigeko Sasamori stands in front of them. It looks as though she wears light pink lipstick. Up close, the scars around her mouth, neck and hands are clearly visible.\nThe morning American pilots dropped an atomic bomb on her city of Hiroshima, 62 years ago, Sasamori was 13. It was the first day of school, and she and other students were out on the street. \"It was beautiful blue sky,\" she says. \"I looked at the sky, the airplane I saw, and I told my classmate next to me, 'Look. That plane is so pretty.'\"\n\"I saw white things dropping,\" she says, referring most likely to the atomic bomb called Little Boy, which was dropped by parachute from a B-29 plane. \"Next, a very strong wind knocked me down. Then, I black out.\"\nWith a third of her body burned, she spent the next five days drifting in and out of consciousness in a school dormitory, repeating her name and address and asking for a drink of water. Eventually, she was reunited with her parents, both of whom survived the bombing. Of all her family members, she was the only one burned, though her father suffered from radiation sickness. \"He was throwing up, having diarrhea and purple things coming out.\"\nTen years later, Sasamori and 24 other \"Hiroshima Maidens\" found themselves at New York City's Mt. Sinai Hospital. A group of American citizens, horrified by the U.S. atomic bombing of Japan, had sponsored reconstructive surgery for the women. The project was borne of a friendship between the Rev. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, the minister at Sasamori's church, and Norman Cousins, an American writer and peace activist, who eventually adopted Sasamori. The doctors and nurses who treated her at Mt. Sinai made her so comfortable and relaxed, she says, that she wanted to do the same for other patients. Eventually, she became a hospital nurse, working with babies.\nIt's only when speaking of children that frequently smiling Sasamori becomes somber. \"I see new babies come into this world, and I don't want to see them to go to dangerous wars,\" she says in her choppy English, while making a cradling motion with her arms. \"I hold them and I say, 'Not this baby -- not this baby happen what happen to me.'\" Looking back out at the audience of young people, Sasamori pleads with the students, \"No more war, no more war. Please young people, do not make war. We need a peaceful revolution.\" She tells her story about the bombing of Hiroshima, she says, not to be a “crybaby, only to touch the good part of the heart.”\nEven when talking of her visit the day before to Los Alamos National Laboratory -- birthplace of the bomb that destroyed her city -- Sasamori expresses no anger. Instead, she talks of how her body tingled: “Wow, maybe the radiation is hitting me all over again. You can't hear radiation, or smell it, but there is a really wicked witch there,\" she says. “So I say, 'People working there, please get out of this city!'\"\nSasamori has a second goal: As a new board member of a Albuquerque-based disarmament organization, the Los Alamos Study Group, she has come to speak with New Mexico's lawmakers. Her hope is that they will join her call for ending the production of nuclear weapons in the United States. New Mexico not only helped to spawn the atomic bomb, which was built at Los Alamos and tested at Nevada’s Trinity Site, but the state is also home to two nuclear-weapons factories, including Los Alamos. Today, they manufacture triggers for nuclear warheads.\nThe same week of Sasamori's visit, the Energy Department announced it had placed one of those triggers inside a nuclear warhead, which is carried on a submarine-launched Cruise missile. Currently, the United States stockpiles more than 10,000 nuclear warheads, and about 1,900 are stored on the edge of Albuquerque, at Kirtland Air Force Base. But though Sasamori tried to meet with New Mexico’s major elected officials, only the staff of Democratic Rep. Tom Udall agreed to see her.\nShe says she had one question she wanted to ask each of them: \"Why is America still making nuclear weapons?\"\nLaura Paskus is a contributor to Writers on the Range, a service of High Country News (hcn.org).

{"text": "Latinxs are two times more likely to remain uninsured\nLatinxs in California made significant gains following the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The number of California Latinxs who were uninsured decreased by 1.5 million, falling from 23 percent to 12 percent. Nevertheless, the Latinx population continues to be the highest group of uninsured when compared with other racial and ethnic communities. In California, Latinxs are two times more likely than other nonelderly racial/ethnic groups to be uninsured even with full implementation of the ACA.\nAfter ACA 13.7% of California’s Latinxs remain uninsured\nRecent research has confirmed that nine years after the ACA became law 13.7 percent of California’s Latinxs remain uninsured. Of these, 21.6 percent of uninsured Latinxs (0-64 years old) who are eligible for Medi-Cal are not enrolled, and 76 percent of uninsured Latinx children (0-18 years old) qualify for Medi-Cal but are not enrolled. This lack of coverage has important implications for the well-being of Californians who are Latinxs.\nPeople with limited English proficiency, work jobs less likely to provide insurance through employers\nVarious factors explain these disparities. Latinx, particularly those with limited English proficiency, work in industries or in jobs that are less likely to have insurance through an employer. They are more likely to be employed as domestic workers or in other informal job settings where there is no documented employment. Immigration status is also a major barrier. In addition, fear of national immigration policies may also have a chilling effect on enrollment.\nPublic charge rule, intimidates and stops Latinxs from enrolling\nThe new final public charge rule – yet another cruel policy by the current Trump Administration to confuse and intimidate immigrants – is going to deter Latinxs from enrolling in health insurance. For more than a century, immigration law has allowed officials to deny individuals admission to the U.S. or adjustment to lawful permanent residence status if they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.” The prior policy defined a public charge as an individual who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.\nNow, the Trump administration has issued a rule that dramatically expands the definition of “public charge” to include individuals who use Medicaid (with some exceptions), SNAP, and housing benefits. The National Health Law Program and other organizations have filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of California to challenge this new senseless measure. Other cases have also been filed in other jurisdictions.\nPublic charge rule dissuades Latinx people from Medi-Cal enrollment\nIn addition to legal barriers, the rule will have chilling effects that will dissuade Latinx people from enrolling in Medi-Cal and programs that are not even subject to the public charge rule such as Covered California. This is in part due to the confusing rule changes, and the perpetuation of the xenophobic and racist origins of public charge, which were based on stereotypes of certain racial/ethnic groups of immigrants.\nIn January 2020, California will offer Medi-Cal to young adults under the age of 26 regardless of their immigration status\nCalifornia is taking action to increase enrollment of Latinx people in health insurance, including Medi-Cal. Starting on January 1, 2020, California will offer full scope Medi-Cal to young adults under the age of 26 irrespective of their immigration status. To ensure successful implementation, the California Department of Health Care Services is working closely with advocates, including the National Health Law Program, as well as County Welfare Directors Association of California, county social services agencies, and Covered California. Although the threats are increasing at the federal level, the Golden State is trying to lessen the damage of these draconian policies."}
{"text": "WHEN, during the fourth century, the weakened empire split asunder like an overburdened scale whose beam is broken, this political divorce perpetuated a moral separation that had existed for a long time. The opposition between the Greco-Oriental and the Latin worlds manifests itself especially in religion and in the attitude taken by the central power toward it.\nOccidental paganism was almost exclusively Latin under the empire. After the annexation of Spain, Gaul and Brittany, the old Iberian, Celtic and other religions were unable to keep up the unequal struggle against the more advanced religion of the conquerors. The marvelous rapidity with which the literature of the civilizing Romans was accepted by the subject peoples has frequently been pointed out. Its influence was felt in the temples as well as in the forum; it transformed the prayers to the gods as well as the conversation between men. Besides, it was part of the political program of the Cæsars to make the adoption of the Roman divinities general, and the government imposed the rules of its sacerdotal law as well as the principles of its public and civil law upon its new subjects. The municipal laws prescribed the election of pontiffs and augurs in common with the judicial duumvirs. In Gaul druidism, with its oral traditions embodied in\nlong poems, perished and disappeared less on account of the police measures directed against it than in consequence of its voluntary relinquishment by the Celts, as soon as they came under the ascendency of Latin culture. In Spain it is difficult to find any traces of the aboriginal religions. Even in Africa, where the Punic religion was far more developed, it maintained itself only by assuming an entirely Roman appearance. Baal became Saturn and Eshmoun Æsculapius. It is doubtful if there was one temple in all the provinces of Italy and Gaul where, at the time of the disappearance of idolatry, the ceremonies were celebrated according to native rites and in the local idiom. To this exclusive predominance of Latin is due the fact that it remained the only liturgic language of the Occidental church, which here as in many other cases perpetuated a preexisting condition and maintained a unity previously established. By imposing her speech upon the inhabitants of Ireland and Germany, Christian Rome simply continued the work of assimilation in the barbarian provinces subject to her influence that she had begun while pagan. 2_1\nIn the Orient, however, the churches that are separate from the Greek orthodoxy use, even to-day, a variety of dialects calling to mind the great diversity of races formerly subject to Rome. In those times twenty varieties of speech translated the religious thought of the peoples joined under the dominion of the Cæsars. At the beginning of our era Hellenism had not yet conquered the uplands of Anatolia 2_2 nor central Syria, nor the divisions of Egypt. Annexation to the empire might retard and in certain regions weaken the power of expansion of Greek civilization,\nbut it could not substitute Latin culture for it 2_3 except around the camps of the legions guarding the frontier and in a very few colonies. It especially benefitted the individuality of each region. The native religions retained all their prestige and independence. In their ancient sanctuaries that took rank with the richest and most famous of the world, a powerful clergy continued to practise ancestral devotions according to barbarian rites, and frequently in a barbarian tongue. The traditional liturgy, everywhere performed with scrupulous respect, remained Egyptian or Semitic, Phrygian or Persian, according to the locality.\nNeither pontifical law nor augural science ever obtained credit outside of the Latin world. It is a characteristic fact that the worship of the deified emperors, the only official worship required of every one by the government as a proof of loyalty, should have originated of its own accord in Asia, received its inspiration from the purest monarchic traditions, and revived in form and spirit the veneration accorded to the Diadochi by their subjects.\nNot only were the gods of Egypt and Asia never supplanted like those of Gaul or Spain, but they soon crossed the seas and gained worshipers in every Latin province. Isis and Serapis, Cybele and Attis, the Syrian Baals, Sabazius and Mithra were honored by brotherhoods of believers as far as the remotest limits of Germany. The Oriental reaction that we perceive from the beginning of our era, in studying the history of art, literature, and philosophy, manifested itself with incomparably greater power in the religious sphere. First, there was a slow infiltration of despised exotic religions, then, toward the end of the first century,\nthe Orontes, the Nile and the Halys, to use the words of Juvenal, flowed into the Tiber, to the great indignation of the old Romans. Finally, a hundred years later, an influx of Egyptian, Semitic and Persian beliefs and conceptions took place that threatened to submerge all that the Greek and Roman genius had laboriously built up. What called forth and permitted this spiritual commotion, of which the triumph of Christianity was the outcome? Why was the influence of the Orient strongest in the religious field? These questions claim our attention. Like ail great phenomena of history, this particular one was determined by a number of influences that concurred in producing it. In the mass of half-known particulars that brought it about, certain factors or leading causes, of which every one has in turn been considered the most important, may be distinguished.\nIf we yielded to the tendency of many excellent minds of to-day and regarded history as the resultant of economic and social forces, it would be easy to show their influence in that great religious movement. The industrial and commercial preponderance of the Orient was manifest, for there were situated the principal centers of production and export. The ever increasing traffic with the Levant induced merchants to establish themselves in Italy, in Gaul, in the Danubian countries, in Africa and in Spain; in some cities they formed real colonies. The Syrian emigrants were especially numerous. Compliant, quick and diligent, they went wherever they expected profit, and their colonies, scattered as far as the north of Gaul, were centers for the religious propaganda of paganism just as the Jewish communities of the Diaspora were for Christian preaching.\n[paragraph continues] Italy not only bought her grain from Egypt, she imported men also; she ordered slaves from Phrygia, Cappadocia, Syria and Alexandria to cultivate her depopulated fields and perform the domestic duties in her palaces. Who can tell what influence chambermaids from Antioch or Memphis gained over the minds of their mistresses? At the same time the necessities of war removed officers and men from the Euphrates to the Rhine or to the outskirts of the Sahara, and everywhere they remained faithful to the gods of their far-away country. The requirements of the government transferred functionaries and their clerks, the latter frequently of servile birth, into the most distant provinces. Finally, the ease of communication, due to the good roads, increased the frequency and extent of travel.\nThus the exchange of products, men and ideas necessarily increased, and it might be maintained that theocracy was a necessary consequence of the mingling of the races, that the gods of the Orient followed the great commercial and social currents, and that their establishment in the Occident was a natural result of the movement that drew the excess population of the Asiatic cities and rural districts into the less thickly inhabited countries.\nThese reflections, which could be developed at some length, surely show the way in which the Oriental religions spread. It is certain that the merchants acted as missionaries in the seaports and places of commerce, the soldiers on the frontiers and in the capital, the slaves in the city homes, 2_4 in the rural districts and in public affairs. But while this acquaints us with the means and the agents of the diffusion of those religions,\nit tells us nothing of the reasons for their adoption by the Romans. We perceive the how, but not the why, of their sudden expansion. Especially imperfect is our understanding of the reasons for the difference between the Orient and the Occident pointed out above.\nAn example will make my meaning clear. A Celtic divinity, Epona, 2_5 was held in particular honor as the protectress of horses, as we all know. The Gallic horsemen worshiped her wherever they were cantoned; her monuments have been found scattered from Scotland to Transylvania. And yet, although this goddess enjoyed the same conditions as, for instance, Jupiter Dolichenus whom the cohorts of Commagene introduced into Europe, it does not appear that she ever received the homage of many strangers; it does not appear, above all, that druidism ever assumed the shape of \"mysteries of Epona\" into which Greeks and Romans would have asked to be initiated. It was too deficient in the intrinsic strength of the Oriental religions, to make proselytes.\nOther historians and thinkers of to-day prefer to apply the laws of natural science to religious phenomena; and the theories about the variation of species find an unforeseen application here. It is maintained that the immigration of Orientals, of Syrians in particular, was considerable enough to provoke an alteration and rapid deterioration in the robust Italic and Celtic races. In addition, a social status contrary to nature, and a bad political régime effected the destruction of the strongest, the extermination of the best and the ascendancy of the worst elements of the population. This multitude, corrupted by deleterious cross-breeding and weakened by bad selection, became unable to oppose\nthe invasion of the Asiatic chimeras and aberrations. A lowering of the intellectual level and the disappearance of the critical spirit accompanied the decline of morals and the weakening of character. In the evolution of beliefs the triumph of the Orient denoted a regression toward barbarism, a return to the remote origins of faith and to the worship of natural forces. This is a brief outline of explanations recently proposed and received with some favor. 2_6\nIt cannot be denied that souls and morals appear to have become coarser during the Roman decline. Society as a whole was deplorably lacking in imagination, intellect and taste. It seemed afflicted with a kind of cerebral anemia and incurable sterility. The impaired reason accepted the coarsest superstitions, the most extreme asceticism and most extravagant theurgy. It resembled an organism incapable of defending itself against contagion. All this is partly true; but the theories summarized proceed from an incorrect conception of things; in reality they are based on the illusion that Asia, under the empire, was inferior to Europe. While the triumph of the Oriental religions sometimes assumed the appearance of an awakening of savagery, these religions in reality represented a more advanced type in the evolution of religious forms than the ancient national devotions. They were less primitive, less simple, and, if I may use the expression, provided with more organs than the old Greco-Roman idolatry. We have indicated this on previous occasions, and hope to bring it out with perfect clearness in the course of these studies.\nIt is hardly necessary to state that a great religious conquest can be explained only on moral grounds.\n[paragraph continues] Whatever part must be ascribed to the instinct of imitation and the contagion of example, in the last analysis we are always face to face with a series of individual conversions. The mysterious affinity of minds is as much due to reflection as to the continued and almost unconscious influence of confused aspirations that produce faith. The obscure gestation of a new ideal is accomplished with pangs of anguish. Violent struggles must have disturbed the souls of the masses when they were torn away from their old ancestral religions, or more often from indifference, by those exacting gods who demanded a surrender of the entire person, a devotion in the etymological meaning of the word. The consecration to Isis of the hero of Apuleius was the result of a call, of an appeal, by the goddess who wanted the neophyte to enlist in her sacred militia. 2_7\nIf it is true that every conversion involves a psychological crisis, a transformation of the intimate personality of the individual, this is especially true of the propagation of the Oriental religions. Born outside of the narrow limits of the Roman city, they grew up frequently in hostility to it, and were international, consequently individual. The bond that formerly kept devotion centered upon the city or the tribe, upon the gens or the family, was broken. In place of the ancient social groups communities of initiates came into existence, who considered themselves brothers no matter where they came from. 2_8 A god, conceived of as being universal, received every mortal as his child. Whenever these religions had any relation to the state they were no longer called upon to support old municipal or social institutions, but to lend their strength to the\nauthority of a sovereign regarded as the eternal lord of the whole world jointly with God himself. In the circles of the mystics, Asiatics mingled with Romans, and slaves with high functionaries. The adoption of the same faith made the poor freedman the equal and sometimes the superior, of the decurion and the clarissimus. All submitted to the same rules and participated in the same festivities, in which the distinctions of an aristocratic society and the differences of blood and country were obliterated. The distinctions of race and nationality, of magistrate and father of a family, of patrician and plebeian, of citizen and foreigner, were abolished; all were but men, and in order to recruit members, those religions worked upon man and his character.\nIn order to gain the masses and the cream of Roman society (as they did for a whole century) the barbarian mysteries had to possess a powerful charm, they had to satisfy the deep wants of the human soul, and their strength had to be superior to that of the ancient Greco-Roman religion. To explain the reasons for their victory we must try to reveal the nature of this superiority--I mean their superiority in the struggle, without assuming innate superiority.\nI believe that we can define it by stating that those religions gave greater satisfaction first, to the senses and passions, secondly, to the intelligence, finally, and above all, to the conscience.\nIn the first place, they appealed more strongly to the senses. This was their most obvious feature, and it has been pointed out more often than any other. Perhaps there never was a religion so cold and prosaic as the Roman. Being subordinated to politics, it sought,\nabove all, to secure the protection of the gods for the state and to avert the effects of their malevolence by the strict execution of appropriate practices. It entered into a contract with the celestial powers from which mutual obligations arose: sacrifices on one side, favors on the other. The pontiffs, who were also magistrates, regulated the religious practices with the exact precision of jurists; 2_9 as far as we know the prayers were all couched in formulas as dry and verbose as notarial instruments. The liturgy reminds one of the ancient civil law on account of the minuteness of its prescriptions. This religion looked suspiciously at the abandonment of the soul to the ecstasies of devotion. It repressed, by force if necessary, the exuberant manifestations of too ardent faith and everything that was not in keeping with the grave dignity befitting the relations of a civis Romanus with a god. The Jews had the same scrupulous respect as the Romans for a religious code and formulas of the past, \"but in spite of their dry and minute practices, the legalism of the Pharisees stirred the heart more strongly than did Roman formalism.\" 2_10\nLacking the recognized authority of official creeds, the Oriental religions had to appeal to the passions of the individual in order to make proselytes. They attracted men first by the disturbing seductiveness of their mysteries, where terror and hope were evoked in turns, and charmed them by the pomp of their festivities and the magnificence of their processions. Men were fascinated by the languishing songs and intoxicating melodies. Above all these religions taught men how to reach that blissful state in which the soul was freed from the tyranny of the body and of suffering,\nand lost itself in raptures. They led to ecstasy either by means of nervous tension resulting from continued maceration and fervent contemplation or by more material means like the stimulation of vertiginous dances and dizzy music, or even by the absorption of fermented liquors after a long abstinence, 2_11 as in the case of the priests of the Great Mother. In mysticism it is easy to descend from the sublime to the vile.\nEven the gods, with whom the believers thought they were uniting themselves in their mystic outbursts, were more human and sometimes more sensual than those of the Occident. The latter had that quietude of soul in which the philosophic morality of the Greeks saw a privilege of the sage; in the serenity of Olympus they enjoyed perpetual youth; they were Immortals. The divinities of the Orient, on the contrary, suffered and died, but only to revive again. 2_12 Osiris, Attis and Adonis were mourned like mortals by wife or mistress, Isis, Cybele or Astarte. With them the mystics moaned for their deceased god and later, after he had revived, celebrated with exultation his birth to a new life. Or else they joined in the passion of Mithra, condemned to create the world in suffering. This common grief and joy were often expressed with savage violence, by bloody mutilations, long wails of despair, and extravagant acclamations. The manifestations of the extreme fanaticism of those barbarian races that had not been touched by Greek skepticism and the very ardor of their faith inflamed the souls of the multitudes attracted by the exotic gods.\nThe Oriental religions touched every chord of sensibility and satisfied the thirst for religious emotion that the austere Roman creed had been unable to quench.\n[paragraph continues] But at the same time they satisfied the, intellect more fully, and this is my second point.\nIn very early times Greece--later imitated by Rome--became resolutely rationalistic: her greatest originality lies here. Her philosophy was purely laical; thought was unrestrained by any sacred tradition; it even pretended to pass judgment upon these traditions and condemned or approved of them. Being sometimes hostile, sometimes indifferent and some times conciliatory, it always remained independent of faith. But while Greece thus freed herself from the fetters of a superannuated mythology, and openly and boldly constructed those systems of metaphysics by means of which she claimed to solve the enigmas of the universe, her religion lost its vitality and dried up because it lacked the strengthening nourishment of reflection. It became a thing devoid of sense, whose raison d'être was no longer understood; it embodied dead ideas and an obsolete conception of the world. In Greece as well as at Rome it was reduced to a collection of unintelligible rites, scrupulously and mechanically reproduced without addition or omission because they had been practised by the ancestors of long ago, and formulas hallowed by the mos maiorum, that were no longer understood or sincerely cherished. Never did a people of advanced culture have a more infantile religion.\nThe Oriental civilizations on the contrary were sacerdotal in character. As in medieval Europe, the scholars of Asia and Egypt were priests. In the temples the nature of the gods and of man were not the only subjects of discussion; mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philology and history were also studied. The successors of Berosus, a priest from Babylonia, and\n[paragraph continues] Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, were considered deeply versed in all intellectual disciplines as late as the time of Strabo. 2_13\nThis state of affairs proved detrimental to the progress of science. Researches were conducted according to preconceived ideas and were perverted through strange prejudices. Astrology and magic were the monstrous fruit of a hybrid union. But all this certainly gave religion a power it had never possessed either in Greece or Rome.\nAll results of observation, all conquests of thought, were used by an erudite clergy to attain the principal object of their activities, the solution of the problem of the destiny of man and matter, and of the relations of heaven and earth. An ever enlarging conception of the universe kept transforming the modes of belief. Faith presumed to enslave both physics and metaphysics. The credit of every discovery was given to the gods. Thoth in Egypt and Bel in Chaldea were the revealers not only of theology and the ritual, but of all human knowledge. 2_14 The names of the Oriental Hipparchi and Euclids who solved the first problems of astronomy and geometry were unknown; but a confused and grotesque literature made use of the name and authority of Hermes Trismegistus. The doctrines of the planetary spheres and the opposition of the four elements were made to support systems of anthropology and of morality; the theorems of astronomy were used to establish an alleged method of divination; formulas of incantation, supposed to subject divine powers to the magician, were combined with chemical experiments and medical prescriptions.\nThis intimate union of erudition and faith continued\nin the Latin world. Theology became more and more a process of deification of the principles or agents discovered by science and a worship of time regarded as the first cause, the stars whose course determined the events of this world, the four elements whose innumerable combinations produced the natural phenomena, and especially the sun which preserved heat, fertility and life. The dogmas of the mysteries of Mithra were, to a certain extent, the religious expression of Roman physics and astronomy. In all forms of pantheism the knowledge of nature appears to be inseparable from that of God. 2_15 Art itself complied more and more with the tendency to express erudite ideas by subtle symbolism, and it represented in allegorical figures the relations of divine powers and cosmic forces, like the sky, the earth, the ocean, the planets, the constellations and the winds. The sculptors engraved on stone everything man thought and taught. In a general way the belief prevailed that redemption and salvation depended on the revelation of certain truths, on a knowledge of the gods, of the world and of our person, and piety became gnosis. 2_16\nBut, you will say, since in the classic age philosophy also claimed to lead to morality through instruction and to acquaint man with the supreme good, why did it yield to Oriental religions that were in reality neither original nor innovating? Quite right, and if a powerful rationalist school, possessed of a good critical method, had led the minds, we may believe that it would have checked the invasion of the barbarian mysteries or at least limited their field of action. However, as has frequently been pointed out, even in ancient Greece the philosophic critics had very little hold on\npopular religion obstinately faithful to its inherited superstitious forms. But how many second century minds shared Lucian's skepticism in regard to the dogmatic systems! The various sects were fighting each other for ever so long without convincing one another of their alleged error. The satirist of Samosata enjoyed opposing their exclusive pretensions while he himself reclined on the \"soft pillow of doubt.\" But only intelligent minds could delight in doubt or surrender to it; the masses wanted certainties. There was nothing to revive confidence in the power of a decrepit and threadbare science. No great discovery transformed the conception of the universe. Nature no longer betrayed her secrets, the earth remained unexplored and the past inscrutable. Every branch of knowledge was forgotten. The world cursed with sterility, could but repeat itself; it had the poignant appreciation of its own decay and impotence. Tired of fruitless researches, the mind surrendered to the necessity of believing. Since the intellect was unable to formulate a consistent rule of life faith alone could supply it, and the multitudes gravitated toward the temples, where the truths taught to man in earlier days by the Oriental gods were revealed. The stanch adherence of past generations to beliefs and rites of unlimited antiquity seemed to guarantee their truth and efficacy. This current was so strong that philosophy itself was swept toward mysticism and the neo-Platonist school became a theurgy.\nThe Oriental mysteries, then, could stir the soul by arousing admiration and terror, pity and enthusiasm in turn. They gave the intellect the illusion of learned depth and absolute certainty and finally--our third\npoint--they satisfied conscience as well as passion and reason. Among the complex causes that guaranteed their domination, this was without doubt the most effective.\nIn every period of their history the Romans, unlike the Greeks in this respect, judged theories and institutions especially by their practical results. They always had a soldier's and business man's contempt for metaphysicians. It is a matter of frequent observation that the philosophy of the Latin world neglected metaphysical speculations and concentrated its attention on morals, just as later the Roman church left to the subtle Hellenes the interminable controversies over the essence of the divine logos and the double nature of Christ. Questions that could rouse and divide her were those having a direct application to life, like the doctrine of grace.\nThe old religion of the Romans had to respond to this demand of their genius. Its poverty was honest. 2_17 Its mythology did not possess the poetic charm of that of Greece, nor did its gods have the imperishable beauty of the Olympians, but they were more moral, or at least pretended to be. A large number were simply personified qualities, like chastity and piety. With the aid of the censors they imposed the practice of the national virtues, that is to say of the qualities useful to society, temperance, courage, chastity, obedience to parents and magistrates, reverence for the oath and the law, in fact, the practice of every form of patriotism. During the last century of the republic the pontiff Scaevola, one of the foremost men of his time, rejected as futile the divinities of fable and poetry, as superfluous or obnoxious those of the philosophers and the exegetists,\nand reserved all his favors for those of the statesmen, as the only ones fit for the people. 2_18 These were the ones protecting the old customs, traditions and frequently even the old privileges. But in the perpetual flux of things conservatism ever carries with it a germ of death. just as the law failed to maintain the integrity of ancient principles, like the absolute power of the father of the family, principles that were no longer in keeping with the social realities, so religion witnessed the foundering of a system of ethics contrary to the moral code that had slowly been established. The idea of collective responsibility contained in a number of beliefs is one instance. If a vestal violated her vow of chastity the divinity sent a pest that ceased only on the day the culprit was punished. Sometimes the angry heavens granted victory to the army only on condition that a general or soldier dedicate himself to the infernal gods as an expiatory victim. However, through the influence of the philosophers and the jurists the conviction slowly gained ground that each one was responsible for his own misdeeds, and that it was not equitable to make a whole city suffer for the crime of an individual. People ceased to admit that the gods crushed the good as well as the wicked in one punishment. Often, also, the divine anger was thought to be as ridiculous in its manifestations as in its cause. The rural superstitions of the country districts of Latium continued to live in the pontifical code of the Roman people. If a lamb with two heads or a colt with five legs was born, solemn supplications were prescribed to avert the misfortunes foreboded by those terrifying prodigies. 2_19\nAll these puerile and monstrous beliefs that burdened\nthe religion of the Latins had thrown it into disrepute. Its morality no longer responded to the new conception of justice beginning to prevail. As a rule Rome remedied the poverty of her theology and ritual by taking what she needed from the Greeks. But here this resource failed her because the poetic, artistic and even intellectual religion of the Greeks was hardly moral. And the fables of a mythology jeered at by the philosophers, parodied on the stage and put to verse by libertine poets were anything but edifying.\nMoreover--this was its second weakness--whatever morality it demanded of a pious man went unrewarded. People no longer believed that the gods continually intervened in the affairs of men to reveal bidden crimes and to punish triumphant vice, or that Jupiter would burl his thunderbolt to crush the perjurer. At the time of the proscriptions and the civil wars under Nero or Commodus it was more than plain that power and possessions were for the strongest, the ablest or even the luckiest, and not for the wisest or the most pious. The idea of reward or punishment beyond the grave found little credit. The notions of future life were hazy, uncertain, doubtful and contradictory. Everybody knows Juvenal's famous lines: \"That there are manes, a subterranean kingdom, a ferryman with a long pole, and black frogs in the whirlpools of the Styx; that so many thousand men could cross the waves in a single boat, to-day even children refuse to believe.\" 2_20\nAfter the fall of the republic indifference spread, the temples were abandoned and threatened to tumble into ruins, the clergy found it difficult to recruit members, the festivities, once so popular, fell into desuetude, and\n[paragraph continues] Varro, at the beginning of his Antiquities, expressed his fear lest \"the gods might perish, not from the blows of foreign enemies, but from very neglect on the part of the citizens.\" 2_21 It is well known that Augustus, prompted by political rather than by religious reasons, attempted to revive the dying religion. His religious reforms stood in close relation to his moral legislation and the establishment of the imperial dignity. Their tendency was to bring the people back to the pious practice of ancient virtues but also to chain them to the new political order. The alliance of throne and altar in Europe dates from that time.\nThis attempted reform failed entirely. Making religion an auxiliary to moral policing is not a means of establishing its empire over souls. Formal reverence for the official gods is not incompatible with absolute and practical skepticism. The restoration attempted by Augustus is nevertheless very characteristic because it is so consistent with the Roman spirit which by temperament and tradition demanded that religion should support morality and the state.\nThe Asiatic religions fulfilled the requirements. The change of régime, although unwelcome, brought about a change of religion. The increasing tendency of Cæsarism toward absolute monarchy made it lean more and more upon the Oriental clergy. True to the traditions of the Achemenides and the Pharaohs, those priests preached doctrines tending to elevate the sovereign above humanity, and they supplied the emperors with dogmatic justification for their despotism. 2_22\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the rulers who most loudly proclaimed their autocratic pretentions, like Domitian\nand Commodus, were also those that favored foreign creeds most openly.\nBut his selfish support merely sanctioned a power already established. The propaganda of the Oriental religions was originally democratic and sometimes even revolutionary like the Isis worship. Step by step they advanced, always reaching higher social classes and appealing to popular conscience rather than to the zeal of functionaries.\nAs a matter of fact all these religions, except that of Mithra, seem at first sight to be far less austere than the Roman creed. We shall have occasion to note that they contained coarse and immodest fables and atrocious or vile rites. The Egyptian gods were expelled from Rome by Augustus and Tiberius on the charge of being immoral, but they were called immoral principally because they opposed a certain conception of the social order. They gave little attention to the public interest but attached considerable importance to the inner life and consequently to the value of the individual. Two new things, in particular, were brought to Italy by the Oriental priests: mysterious methods of purification, by which they claimed to wash away the impurities of the soul, and the assurance that a blessed immortality would be the reward of piety. 2_23\nThese religions pretended to restore lost purity 2_24 to the soul either through the performance of ritual ceremonies or through mortifications and penance. They had a series of ablutions and lustrations supposed to restore original innocence to the mystic. He had to wash himself in the sacred water according to certain prescribed forms. This was really a magic rite, because bodily purity acted sympathetically upon the soul, or\nelse it was a real spiritual disinfection with the water driving out the evil spirits that had caused pollution. The votary, again, might drink or besprinkle himself with the blood of a slaughtered victim or of the priests themselves, in which case the prevailing idea was that the liquid circulating in the veins was a vivifying principle capable of imparting a new existence. 2_25 These and similar rites 2_26 used in the mysteries were supposed to regenerate the initiated person and to restore him to an immaculate and incorruptible life. 2_27\nPurgation of the soul was not. effected solely by liturgic acts but also by self-denial and suffering. 2_28 The meaning of the term expiatio changed. Expiation, or atonement, was no longer accomplished by the exact performance of certain ceremonies pleasing to the gods and required by a sacred code like a penalty for damages, but by privation and personal suffering. Abstinence, which prevented the introduction of deadly elements into the system, and chastity, which preserved man from pollution and debility, became means of getting rid of the domination of the evil Powers and of regaining heavenly favor. 2_29 Macerations, laborious pilgrimages, public confessions, sometimes flagellations and mutilations, in fact all forms of penance and mortifications uplifted the fallen man and brought him nearer to the gods. In Phrygia a sinner would write his sin and the punishment he suffered upon a stela for every one to see and would return thanks to heaven that his prayer of repentance had been heard. 2_30 The Syrian, who had offended his goddess by eating her sacred fish, dressed in sordid rags, covered himself with a sack and sat in the public highway humbly to proclaim his misdeed in order to obtain forgiveness. 2_31\n[paragraph continues] \"Three times, in the depths of winter,\" says Juvenal, \"the devotee of Isis will dive into the chilly waters of the Tiber, and shivering with cold, will drag herself around the temple upon her bleeding knees; if the goddess commands, she will go to the outskirts of Egypt to take water from the Nile and empty it within the sanctuary.\" 2_32 This shows the introduction into Europe of Oriental asceticism.\nBut there were impious acts and impure passions that contaminated and defiled the soul. Since this infection could be destroyed only by expiations prescribed by the gods, the extent of the sin and the character of the necessary penance had to be estimated. It was the priest's prerogative to judge the misdeeds and to impose the penalties. This circumstance gave the clergy a very different character from the one it had at Rome. The priest was no longer simply the guardian of sacred traditions, the intermediary between man or the state and the gods, but also a spiritual guide. He taught his flock the long series of obligations and restrictions for shielding their weakness from the attacks of evil spirits. He knew how to quiet remorse and scruples, and to restore the sinner to spiritual calm. Being versed in sacred knowledge, he had the power of reconciling the gods. Frequent sacred repasts maintained a spirit of fellowship among the mystics of Cybele, Mithra or the Baals, 2_33 and a daily service unceasingly revived the faith of the Isis worshipers. In consequence, the clergy were entirely absorbed in their holy office and lived only for and by their temples. Unlike the sacerdotal colleges of Rome in which the secular and religious functions were not yet clearly differentiated, 2_34 they were not an\nadministrative commission ruling the sacred affairs of the state under the supervision of the senate; they formed what might almost be called a caste of recluses distinguished from ordinary men by their insignia, garb, habits and food, and constituting an independent body with a hierarchy, formulary and even councils of their own. 2_35 They did not return to every-day duties as private citizens or to the direction of public affairs as magistrates as the ancient pontiffs had done after the solemn festival service.\nWe can readily understand that these beliefs and institutions were bound to establish the Oriental religions and their priests on a strong basis. Their influence must have been especially powerful at the time of the Cæsars. The laxity of morals at the beginning of our era has been exaggerated but it was real. Many unhealthy symptoms told of a profound moral anarchy weighing on a weakened and irresolute society. The farther we go toward the end of the empire the more its energy seems to fail and the character of men to weaken. The number of strong healthy minds incapable of a lasting aberration and without need of guidance or comfort was growing ever smaller. We note the spread of that feeling of exhaustion and debility which follows the aberrations of passion, and the same weakness that led to crime impelled men to seek absolution in the formal practices of asceticism. They applied to the Oriental priests for spiritual remedies.\nPeople flattered themselves that by performing the rites they would attain a condition of felicity after death. All barbarian mysteries pretended to reveal to their adherents the secret of blessed immortality. Participation in the occult ceremonies of the sect was a\nchief means of salvation. 2_36 The vague and disheartening beliefs of ancient paganism in regard to life after death were transformed into the firm hope of a well-defined form of happiness. 2_37\nThis faith in a personal survival of the soul and even of the body was based upon a strong instinct of human nature, the instinct of self-preservation. Social and moral conditions in the empire during its decline gave it greater strength than it had ever possessed before. 2_38 The third century saw so much suffering, anguish and violence, so much unnecessary ruin and so many unpunished crimes, that the Roman world took refuge in the expectation of a better existence in which all the iniquity of this world would be retrieved. No earthly hope brightened life. The tyranny of a corrupt bureaucracy choked all disposition for political progress. Science stagnated and revealed no more unknown truths. Growing poverty discouraged the spirit of enterprise. The idea gained ground that humanity was afflicted with incurable decay, that nature was approaching her doom and that the end of world was near. 2_39 We must remember all these causes of discouragement and despondency to understand the power of the idea, expressed so frequently, that the spirit animating man was forced by bitter necessity to imprison itself in matter and that it was delivered from its carnal captivity by death. In the heavy atmosphere of a period of oppression and impotence the dejected soul longed with incredible ardor to fly to the radiant abode of heaven.\nTo recapitulate, the Oriental religions acted upon the senses, the intellect and the conscience at the same time, and therefore gained a hold on the entire man.\n[paragraph continues] Compared with the ancient creeds, they appear to have offered greater beauty of ritual, greater truth of doctrine and a far superior morality. The imposing ceremonial of their festivities and the alternating pomp and sensuality, gloom and exaltation of their services appealed especially to the simple and the humble, while the progressive revelation of ancient wisdom, inherited from the old and distant Orient, captivated the cultured mind. The emotions excited by these religions and the consolations offered strongly attracted the women, who were the most fervent and generous followers and most passionate propagandists 2_40 of the religions of Isis and Cybele. Mithra was worshiped almost exclusively by men, whom he subjected to a rigid moral discipline. Thus souls were gained by the promise of spiritual purification and the prospect of eternal happiness.\nThe worship of the Roman gods was a civic duty, the worship of the foreign gods the expression of a personal belief. The latter were the objects of the thoughts, feelings and intimate aspirations of the individual, not merely of the traditional and, one might say, functional adoration of the citizen. The ancient municipal devotions were connected with a number of earthly interests that helped to support each other. They were one of various forms of family spirit and patriotism and guaranteed the prosperity of the community. The Oriental mysteries, directing the will toward an ideal goal and exalting the inner spirit, were less mindful of economic utility, but they could produce that vibration of the moral being that caused emotions, stronger than any rational faculty, to gush forth from the depths of the soul. Through a sudden illumination\nthey furnished the intuition of a spiritual life whose intensity made all material happiness appear insipid and contemptible. This stirring appeal of supernatural life made the propaganda irresistible. The same ardent enthusiasm guaranteed at the same time the uncontested domination of neo-Platonism among the philosophers. Antiquity expired and a new era was born."}

Its central mission is to help renew the civil rights movement by bridging the worlds of ideas and action, and by becoming a preeminent source of intellectual capital and a forum for building consensus within that movement. We achieve this by interweaving strategies of research and policy analysis, and by building strong collaborations between researchers, community organizations, and policy makers. Our dual objectives are to: (1) raise the visibility of, and attention to, racial justice national policy debates; and (2) arm local and national civil rights and educational organizations with credible research to inform their legal, political and public education efforts. CRP wrote the narrative and worked closely with the Urban Institute to analyze the data contained in the report.\nThe Urban Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research and educational organization, examines America's social, economic, and governance problems. It provides information, analyses, and perspectives to public and private decisionmakers to help them address these problems and strives to deepen citizens' understanding of the issues and trade-offs that policymakers face. Its Education Policy Center conducts research on education reforms involving accountability, school vouchers, standards, after-school programs, technology, teacher quality, and the new increased flexibility in using federal funds.

INTRODUCTION: AN INVISIBLE CRISIS\nIn an increasingly competitive, global economy the consequences of dropping out of high school are devastating to individuals, communities and our national economy. At an absolute minimum, adults need a high school diploma if they are to have any reasonable opportunities to earn a living wage. A community where many parents are dropouts is unlikely to have stable families or social structures. Most businesses need workers with technical skills that require at least a high school diploma. Yet, with little notice, the United States is allowing a dangerously high percentage of students to disappear from the educational pipeline before graduating from high school.\nNationally, high school graduation rates are low for all students, with only an estimated 68% of those who enter 9th grade graduating with a regular diploma in12th grade. But, as the table below makes clear, they are substantially lower for most minority groups, and particularly for males. According to the calculations used in this report1, in 2001, only 50% of all black students, 51% of Native American students, and 53% of all Hispanic students graduated from high school. Black, Native American, and Hispanic males fare even worse: 43%, 47%, and 48% respectively.\nTo make matters worse, official \"dropout\" statistics neither accurately count nor report the vast numbers of students who do not graduate from high school. For a variety of reasons that are detailed later in this report, the two major sources used most often - the Center for Educational Statistics and the Current Population Survey - to calculate dropout and graduation rates produce misleading figures. Moreover, because states rarely disaggregate graduation rates by race or socio-economic status, the extremely low graduation rates for racial and ethnic minorities, students with disabilities, low-income students, and students with limited English proficiency subgroups are rarely the focus of debates on education reform. As a result, the public remains largely unaware of this national crisis.\nThis report seeks to highlight these disparities to draw the public's and policymakers' attention to the urgent need to address this educational and civil rights crisis. Using a more accurate method for calculating graduation rates developed by the Urban Institute (see discussion on p. 8) we provide estimates of high school graduation rates, distinguished at the state and district level, and disaggregated by race. We assert that these figures provide a far more realistic portrait of graduation rates in this country than those commonly reported by states and the federal government.\nOur analysis of this data focuses on three major questions: First, how deep and widespread are the racial disparities that exist at the state and district levels? Second, how has the misleading and incomplete reporting of this issue obscured both the magnitude of the crisis and its racial dimensions? Finally, focusing primarily on the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation, we ask whether state and federal accountability systems, as implemented, are appropriately structured to improve high school graduation rates, especially among children of color.\nWoven throughout this report are narratives about students from a sampling of statesAlabama, Florida, New York, Illinois, and Mississippiwho have either dropped or felt \"pushed\" out of school (some are in the 15 state review). Several of these stories illustrate the \"dark side\" of high stakes testing policies. Many of these students and their families express shock and dismay when they are told they will not be allowed to return to school or to graduate because of their poor test performance. Some were conscientious and hard-working, had done well in their classes and had made plans to pursue post-secondary education. Others had experienced severe problems outside of school, but still expressed interest in continuing their education. Yet, they found themselves stranded in an educational no-man's land with few options or advocates. Collectively, these stories suggest that there may be \"perverse incentives\" in many states to push low-performing students out the back door. If true, without more powerful incentives for schools to \"hold onto\" students through graduation, the \"push-out syndrome\" is likely to grow more severe.\nNote: This report is available in its entirety in the Portable Document Format (PDF).\nThe Civil Rights Project at Harvard University would like to thank its extraordinary administrative team, including Marilyn Byrne, Lori Kelley, and Christina Tobias-Nahi for their valuable assistance with this report.

{"text": "In Man Of Steel Superman has lost his usual red underwear. Well, more he never has it in the first place in this adaption. It's no wonder why, no one, not even Batman, wears their underwear outside anymore.\nThat said, Superman still has his cape, something that's seemingly as much an artifact as the underwear thing. Yes, Thor and Loki both have capes, but they're demigods. Batman's cape is explained away as serving not only the effect he creates but a utilitarian purpose as well. Hardly anyone wears capes these days. In The Incredibles, the first superhero deconstruction you saw if you’re my age, Edna Mode goes to great lengths to explain the impracticality of capes in a morbidly comedic sequence.\nSo why does Superman still have his bright red cape? It's doesn't make much sense (see Edna Mode's list for reasons), yet it's part of his costume and and he doesn't rip it off. More importantly, why did the filmmakers choose to keep the cape? It's iconic, sure, but nothing is sacred in adaptions. Here's the deal: capes are heroic. There's the image of the kid with the towel tied round his neck pretending to be a superhero. That's Superman. He's the Boy Scout, the Kansas-bred all-American hero.\nAnd his cape is an integral part of that. Look at the use of capes in the film. General Zod, when we first see him, is wearing a cape. It doesn't take long, however, for him to shrug it off and, of course, become the villain he is. When we first see Superman in his outfit we first see his red boots and red cape. When Superman meets the military, we once again focus on his cape. His cape is what sets him apart. Zod doesn't have a cape, nor do any of his followers; but Jor-El, Superman's father, does. It's a beautiful visual cue, one that speaks to the basis of our pop culture mythology: the person wearing the cape is a good guy, a hero.\nSuch is Superman: he's the archetypical superhero. The cape-wearing, evil-fighting man in tights. Contrast him to Joel, from The Last of Us (because that game is amazing and bears referencing). Joel is not a hero, he's not even a good guy. Joel is a desperate man who's more than willing to do horrible things. Joel is a survivor, he acts solely to survive and protect his own interests. Superman, conversely, simply is good and will protect anyone.\nSo where do we get a narrative? Joel's comes from challenging his interests and upsetting his status quo to see how he reacts. The narrative/arc is clear from the onset, though Naughty Dog makes several bold choices with where to take it. Superman has no obvious arc. He's invincible and infallible; any impending doom or moral dilemma lacks tension because we know Superman can't be hurt and will always do right. After all, he's wearing a cape. So where does the narrative tension come from? How does Man of Steel craft a story that doesn't undermine his character but still delivers an engaging story?\nThe movie addresses the question of the cape. The story's primary tension comes not from Superman vs. Zod, but rather within Superman himself. Clark Kent must become Superman... Or must he? The Clark Kent we meet is a Clark Kent divided. He has these powers, but should he use them? How should he use them? There lies the conflict; the tension is the question of should Clark Kent wear the cape or hide in anonymity. Granted, we already know the answer, but it's a far more interesting arc than \"will he survive?\". Once that question is answered, however, a new one arises: to what lengths will Superman go in pursuit of what the cape means? How far will Superman go to protect someone?\nZack Snyder has described Man of Steel as the least ironic movie he's made. It might be the most honest recent superhero movie besides Captain America, there's no attempt to give Superman the dark and gritty treatment so common in our era of antiheroes. Where The Last of Us gives us an antihero who rings closer to a villain, Man of Steel presents a hero with no doubt of his goodness. So Superman wears a cape."}
{"text": "The fiber laser cutting machine has three major consumables: protective lenses, nozzles, and ceramic rings.\nThe ceramic ring is an important part of the cutting head on the fiber laser cutting machine, which is used to transmit the electrical signals collected by the nozzles of the laser head and stabilize the normal operation of the fiber laser cutting machine.\nThe failures such as the sudden shutdown of the equipment and the laser head hitting the face that we often encounter are actually caused by the instability of the laser ceramic ring.\nTherefore, it is very important to choose a good quality ceramic ring of fiber laser cutting machine. we will introduce you to how to choose a high-quality laser ceramic ring.\nThe laser ceramic ring is composed of a ceramic body, stainless steel parts, and copper pin.\nThe ceramic body is mainly used to maintain fully connected with the nozzle to transmit the electrical signal to the copper pin, which then transmits the electrical signal to the transmission line, and then the internal line of the laser head transmits the signal to the controller.\nAfter the old laser ceramic ring on the market has been used for a period of time, the connection between the stainless steel parts and the copper pin is poor, and even the copper pin is broken, resulting in an unstable signal or even no signal.\nThe fiber laser cutting machine will also stop working for these reasons, or even hit the working face, causing losses to the user.\nSignal stability: the use of a high-quality laser conductive silver glue ceramic ring to ensure a close connection with the stainless steel parts of the ceramic body, while ensuring the electrical conductivity of copper pin and stainless steel parts.\nIn the market, many laser ceramic rings use inferior glue instead of conductive silver glue.\nIn the high-temperature environment, the glue dissolves, and the stainless steel parts are loose, which can not guarantee the electrical conductivity of the product.\nThe accident of laser head hitting the workpiece is easy to occur, which causes great losses to users.\nHigh-quality stainless steel parts ensure good concentricity after assembly with ceramics and carry out a comprehensive inspection.\nAs a result, the concentricity error between the two nozzles can be reduced when the nozzles are changed. if a high-quality nozzle is selected, there is no need to reset the fiber laser cutting machine when the nozzles are in contact with the nozzles.\nThe working time loss is greatly reduced and the working efficiency of the optical fiber laser cutting machine is greatly improved.\nNow the price of the ceramic rings on the market is chaotic, the price of the original ceramic ring is on the high side, especially the original imported ceramic ring, but some domestic ones are quite stable."}

{"text": "U.S. Antiretroviral Therapy Guidelines\nFebruary 18, 2013\nWe keep learning more about the best way to fight HIV. In 1998, the US Department of Health and Human Services created a panel of physicians, researchers, and consumers to develop treatment guidelines. They constantly review AIDS research results. The guidelines are updated about once each year. The panel released the latest guidelines in February 2013.\nNote: These are guidelines, not rules. Patients should receive individualized care from a health care provider with experience treating HIV infection. The full text of these guidelines is available on the Internet at www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/; choose \"Guidelines.\"\nViral load and CD4 cell tests provide critical information for decisions on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Before changing treatment, the tests should be repeated to confirm the results. Fact Sheet 124 has more information on CD4 cell tests and Fact Sheet 125 covers viral load testing.\nViral load should be tested:\nCD4 cell counts should be done:\nViral resistance testing helps health care providers choose the most effective drugs. See Fact Sheet 126 for more information. Resistance testing is recommended for patients starting therapy, when viral load is not controlled by new medications, or when it \"breaks through\" a regimen that used to work. The guidelines recommend resistance testing before starting antiretroviral treatment (ART). It can also make sense for people who don't need to start ART yet. This can show if the person got infected with drug-resistant virus.\nOther Laboratory Tests\nThe guidelines recommend using a viral tropism test (see Fact Sheet 129) before starting therapy with a CCR5 inhibitor. They also suggest using a genetic test, HLA-B*5701 before starting abacavir (see Fact Sheet 416).\nThe guidelines list the following goals for HIV therapy. Treatment goals are the same for people starting therapy and those who have been on therapy for a long time:\nThe following tools are suggested to help achieve these goals:\nThe guidelines list several preferred regimens for people starting anti-HIV treatment. They all contain the nucleoside analogs, emtricitabine (Emtriva) and tenofovir (Viread). Preferred regimens also include raltegravir (Isentress,) efavirenz (Sustiva,) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (Reyataz) or darunavir (Prezista). Many other combinations are listed as \"alternative regimens.\" Other combinations are listed for use only when a preferred or alternative regimen cannot or should not be used.\nSeveral drugs or combinations are listed as \"Not Recommended.\" Some are not recommended for initial therapy due to low anti-HIV activity or inconvenience. Others are not recommended at any time. These include any nuke or non-nuke by itself (monotherapy) or just two nukes because these treatments generally have only limited benefits for a short period of time. Also, the guidelines recommend not using the triple-nuke regimens.\nThere are special considerations for the treatment of pregnant women (Fact Sheet 611), adolescents, drug users, people also infected with hepatitis B (Fact Sheet 506) or hepatitis C (Fact Sheet 507) or with tuberculosis (Fact Sheet 518).\nA patient may need to interrupt treatment for several reasons: side effects are intolerable, there's a drug interaction, if they run out of any of their medications or if they have surgery scheduled.\nTreatment interruptions are not recommended in response to treatment failure.\nART should only be stopped if your health care provider recommends it. Two large studies showed that people who interrupted treatment had a higher rate of HIV-related health problems or death. For more information, see Fact Sheet 406 on treatment interruptions.\nTreatment should be changed due to treatment failure, or intolerance of current drugs.\nTreatment failure: Within 6 months after starting a treatment, the viral load should drop below 400 copies. Within 1 year, it should be less than 50 copies. If the viral load does not drop this much, change the treatment. Other signs of treatment failure include:\nIntolerance: If a patient cannot take the prescribed drugs because of their side effects or interactions with other needed medications, the drugs should be changed.\nDecisions to change ART should include a review of prior treatments, physical exam, resistance testing, adherence and side effects. Ideally, three drugs that the virus will respond to can be identified and used in a new regimen.\nIf there are few options to change to, and viral load was reduced, it may make sense not to change medications. Another option is to use combinations that are more experimental. Treatment interruptions are not recommended.\nThis article was provided by AIDS InfoNet.

{"text": "21. [With regard to animals and fowl] that have been trained and domesticated, and usually return to their places in the evening: if they go out on Shabbos and one fears that they will be stolen, one is permitted to drive them into a safe place. One may not, however, carry them by hand, because they are \"muktzah\" (1).\n(1) There is a rabbinical prohibition against riding or even making use of an animal's body on Shabbos or Yom Tov (Beizta 19a). The reason given by the Talmud Bavli is a concern that one may break off a tree branch (a biblical violation of Shabbos) in order to strike it while leading it along or riding it. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, the reason for the rabbinical prohibition is a concern that one may come to lead the animal into a public domain with a load on its back, which we saw is Biblically prohibited (Aruch Hashulchan 305:16). Due to this rabbinical prohibition against making use of an animal, it is considered \"Muktzah,\" which means one cannot move it or pick it up.\nThere is a dispute among the authorities as to whether one may pick up an animal by hand if it is the only way to prevent it from escaping or being damaged. (See Mishna Berura 305:70, and 308:151)."}
{"text": "Thousands of girls and young women trapped in gangs are living \"desperate lives\" where rape is considered normal, a new report has warned.\nA report by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) into female gang members found sexual exploitation, drugs-running and gun handling is part of their routine life.\nThe think tank, founded by work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, warned \"too little\" is changing despite the launch of a Home Office-led strategy into gang culture three years ago.\nResearchers heard how female members are being pressured to have sex with boys - some as young as 10 - to initiate males into gangs.\nRape is used to control the female members and as a weapon against girls and women associated with rival gangs.\nThe report outlines a case where one schoolgirl was abducted and sexually assaulted by nine males because she criticised a gang member.\nIt also found female members as young as eight are being used to transport weapons and drugs because they are less likely to be stopped by police.\nIt added that in some areas problems have been exacerbated because headteachers have turned a blind eye to gang activity to protect their school's reputation.\nEdward Boyd, CSJ deputy policy director and editor of the report, said: \"We are often unsighted about the desperate lives of girls embroiled in gangs.\n\"While the media regularly shines a spotlight on the criminality of male members, the daily suffering of girls goes largely unnoticed.\n\"They live in a parallel world where rape is used as a weapon and carrying drugs and guns is seen as normal.\"\nThe Girls and Gangs study heard from current gang members, former gang members, charities working with gangs, government agencies and other frontline services.\nThe report added: \"The CSJ said the Government was right in 2011 to identify that authorities did not know enough about girls and young women associated with gangs.\n\"Yet three years later too little progress has been made.\"\nThe think tank urged the Government to \"map the problem\" to allow better intervention work.\nIt wants to see youth workers placed in major trauma units at hospitals in gang-affected areas to find members.\nIt also called for police to team up with voluntary organisations to help the girlfriends of male gang members who are arrested or imprisoned to exit gang life.\nA recent report said almost 2,500 children are known to be victims of child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups - but it is widely agreed this number is a conservative estimate.\nPatrick Regan, chief executive of urban youth charity XLP, said: \"The biggest issue with girls in gangs is that we simply don't know the full extent of the problem.\n\"The data we have is merely the tip of the iceberg and at XLP there is no doubt that we see increasing numbers of girls dragged into this appalling world of exploitation, criminality and hopelessness.\"\nCrime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: \"We are already leading ground breaking work to identify vulnerable women and girls who can get drawn into gangs. Girls associated with gangs can face sexual violence and we have provided £1.2 million for 13 Young People's Advocates to support those at risk.\n\"Along with the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police, we are looking at the scale of girls and women involved in gangs and what can be done to carry out appropriate interventions - good practice will be shared with other forces and local authorities.\n\"We also know we need to change attitudes to prevent young people getting involved in gangs in the first place. In this crucial area, our Ending Gang and Youth Violence programme is reaping rewards.\n\"We've set up a network of over 70 people with front line experience of dealing with gangs to work with 33 of the worst affected areas of the country, including 20 in London. Overall, youth violence has fallen across the local authority areas we're working with under the programme.\""}
{"text": "This strikes us in our hearts and moves us to love Him, and it awakens our consciences from their slumber. Not because we feel guilty, though it is popular to say that our sins crucified Him. But in truth, our sins had no power over Him. In answer to the question, \"Why did He have to suffer and die?\" we answer that He had to have done nothing. Indeed, He owed us nothing. He did not die because He had to, or because we made Him do so. Pilate had no power over Him, the priests and Sanhedrin had no power over Him, the soldiers of Rome who beat, mocked and crucified Him, had no power over Him.\nHear the words Christ had spoken a while before ascending to Jerusalem:\n\"Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life that I might take it again. No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of My Father (John 10: 17, 18).\"\nRemember, as we will read on Friday the Gospel of John, that when they came to arrest Him, they all fell backward, and could not stand up until He spoke again and allowed them to do so. And, as St. Matthew tells us, He spoke these words to Peter:\n\"Put up thy sword into his place...thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be (Mat. 26: 53, 54)?\"\nThe One Who prayed in the Garden, \"Not as I will, but as Thou wilt\" and said \"greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down His life for His friends\" would show greater love than is possible for human strength, as He would die for His friends and His enemies. \"God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Rom. 5:8).\" He set His face as a flint; His face was set toward Jerusalem. No man could make Him go there; no man could send Him to the cross.\nSo our consciences are stricken, and our hearts afflicted, by something more profound than guilt; we are brought low, and moved, by this true drama, to gratitude, to give thanks with tears, moved to love, all of which restores to us hope, and faith, and charity for all. Our consciences are cleansed by His death, and made new. They are made active, they stir to holy living. No longer is our life a matter of rules for the sake of rules, laws for the sake of laws. The Law is written on our hearts by the Holy Ghost along with the deepest recognition that we could not give enough thanks to our Redeemer had we a thousand tongues to sing, and that we will never stop giving thanks for eternity, unto ages of ages, or world without end. It is now personal. \"We love Him because He first loved us.\"\nWe are moved beyond the power of words to tell, not because the cross of Christ makes us guilty in forcing Him to bear our sins; but, rather, because the cross removes our guilt, we are moved to gratitude and to love. It is because He bore our sins in His body on the Tree. \"He was numbered with the transgressors, and He bare the sin of the many, and made intercession for the transgressors (Isa. 53: 12).\" This was the Divine plan, about which we had no say, in which we had no input. Like life itself, it is the free gift of the Triune God to creatures dependent upon His grace, grace to live, and now grace to be restored to His favor. Think upon the words we have read from that famous passage of St. Paul to the Philippians, that He \"was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"\nWhat can that mean if not that the death of the cross was the Divine plan? This is a profound mystery. We can understand the principle that the death of the One Who was without sin, Who never deserved the wages of sin, reverses death and brings eternal life. That His death is, therefore, the sacrifice offered to God by the Righteous One of Himself for all sinners is plain enough as a theological principle, and is itself demonstration of the love of God for the fallen children of Adam. But, the death of the cross, the death of severe pain and humiliation, involving the worst physical suffering man can feel, coupled with all of the shame and torment of cruel mocking and scourging. Why was this the Divine plan? What does each stripe mean? What means the piercing of thorns and nails, the contempt and anger, the beating over the head with a reed? Why the derision of heartless enemies added to the pain of crucifixion? What is all of this about?\nThe answer, as is written in the First Epistle of Saint Peter, is that He “bore our own sins in His body on the tree.” We are proud, are we not, of our minds? Can we not out think all creatures on earth? But, how does God view the vain and selfish use of our minds? He crowns our proud intellects with thorns. We are proud, are we not, of the work of our hands? Have we not made things greater than the Tower of Babel itself? But, what thinks the righteous God of the selfishness with which we labor? Our hands deserve the piercing of nails. We are proud, are we not, of how we walk before God and men? We suppose that we are not like other men, and are just humble enough to render proud thanks as we pray thus to ourselves, \"God, I thank thee.\" But, in the eyes of God our own standard of righteousness tends to self-flattery. What says He of our walk, but that nails should be driven through our feet?\nBut, I think I only scratch the surface of this mystery. Certainly, nothing that happened to the Son of God was an accident. He allowed it all, so it all has meaning, and the mystery is more profound than I can say, of what it means that \"He bore our own sins in His body on the tree.\" The cross shows us the Divine sentence upon our sins, and yet, remember, that we had no power to crucify Him.\nOn this Palm Sunday, let us look at the determination with which He fulfilled His mission. Nothing could keep Him from the purpose for which He came as a Man, and took upon Himself our nature. In the movie The Passion of the Christ, the \"bad\" thief, the one who does not fear God even while dying, is filled with anger at the sight of the Lord embracing His cross. \"Fool!\" he yells, \"Why do you embrace your cross?!\" Christ entered Jerusalem, unmoved by the praise of the crowds, for He had not come to be their King, not yet. He had come to be priest and sacrifice. The great drama of this coming week, the drama Bach expressed so powerfully through music, the drama we feel this day, and which will break our hearts on Thursday night and Friday, is the drama of His love, which produces our love, our thanks; and that afflicts our hearts with both pain and comfort at once. We, though undeserving, are loved."}

I haven’t zeroed in on a particular location yet, so I’ve been watching the national averages. Money Magazine is saying that now is a great time to buy a house, and they were able to pull off the article without any quotations from real estate agents. If, of course, you can qualify for the mortgage, and you still shop around for a deal, buying a house now might be a good choice.\nNotice that I didn’t say that it would be a good investment. There is more than a good chance that the price of your house won’t move up much over the next thirty years. The short boom that we saw in the real estate market might be over, not to return for fifty years or even a century, if ever. Consider the expenses that you pour into owning a home, and you might not even come out with a profit when you sell.\nIt shouldn’t be the pseudo-investment aspects of owning a house that interests a buyer, it should be the ability to customize your living space and tailor it to what you and your family would like. That’s the primary benefit of ownership, but even that isn’t necessary for many people. Continuing to rent is always a valid option, skipping time-consuming maintenance needs and up-keep expenses, but having the possibility of increasing rent and the the need to rely on a landlord to take care of problems.\nWould you buy a home today?\nUpdated January 3, 2011 and originally published December 14, 2010.

{"text": "This article is reposted from the old WordPress incarnation of Not Exactly Rocket Science.\nImagine you get a bad cold, but you decide to put on a brave face and go into work anyway. Instead of jokingly covering their mouths and making jibes about staying away from you, your colleagues act perfectly normally and some even and start rubbing up against you. It’s a weird scenario, but not if you were an ant.\nWith their large colonies and intense co-operation, ants are some of the most successful animals on the planet. But like all social insects and animals, their large group sizes make them vulnerable breeding grounds for parasites and infections. A infectious disease in a tightly knit colony spells trouble and it’s no surprise that social insects have evolved ways of stopping the spread of infections.\nSome are sticklers for hygiene and meticulously clean their peers while others quarantine infected individuals in colony sick chambers. Some termites even warn their peers to stay away through head-banging. And bees kill off a heat-resistant bacteria by gathering in an infected part of the colony and raising its temperature, effectively setting off a ‘colony fever’.\nNow, scientists from the University of Copenhagen have found that some ants use a form of collective immunity, where infected individuals trigger resistance in those around them through contact.\nLine Ugelvig and Sylvia Cremer looked at how ants deal with infections by setting up groups of garden ants (Lasius neglectus) including five workers and three larvae in a separate chamber. They then introduced a sixth adult that was either healthy, dusted with live fungal spores, or dusted with inert spores whose DNA had been wrecked by ultraviolet radiation bombardment and could no longer infect.\nThe infected newcomers spent about half as much time in the brood chamber than the non-infected ones, presumably to avoid spreading the spores to the young. The existing workers also noticed the presence of live spores and cared for the larvae more intensely than normal.\nThis change in behaviour didn’t actually depend on the health of the new ant, as all the parties concerned reacted accordingly before the spores had a chance to germinate. And amazingly, the ants seems to be able to sense the presence of spores, and they can even tell the difference between those that can infect and those that can’t.\nEven though the ants can detect live spores, the five workers spent as much time in contact with the sixth ant in all situations, infected or not. That seems strange – surely it would benefit the adults to avoid infection just as it would the larvae?\nTo see if rubbing up against an infected peer had any benefit, Ugelvig and Cremer applied the fungus spores to all of the adults in the group after five days. They saw that ants with no previous experience with the spores were about 50-70% more likely to die than those which had made contact with an infected newcomer.\nUgelvig and Cremer believe that the ants are using a sort of social immunity, where an infected individual passes on a form of protection to its nestmates. Another study in 2005 showed that termites may also use the same trick. They were more likely to develop a strong immune response to a fungus if they were kept in groups than in solitary confinement.\nSocial immunity could work in two ways. The spore-ridden ant could pass the spores themselves onto others, triggering immune responses in the rest of the group, or it could pass on immune chemicals, like antibodies.\nWhatever the case, it’s a powerful strategy for protecting the health of the colony. If a parasite enters the colony, contact-based immunity would rapidly create a ring of resistant individuals around the infected one, shielding the rest of the colony from the spread of disease.\nReference: Ugelvig & Cremer. 2007.

{"text": "There is a lot of exciting stuff going on in the stars above us that make astronomy so much fun. The truth is the universe is a constantly changing, moving, some would say “living” thing because you just never know what you are going to see on any given night of stargazing.\nBut of the many celestial phenomenons, there is probably none as exciting as that time you see your first asteroid on the move in the heavens. To call asteroids the “rock stars” of astronomy is simultaneously a bad joke but an accurate depiction of how astronomy fans view them. Unlike suns, planets and moons, asteroids are on the move, ever changing and, if they appear in the night sky, exciting and dynamic.\nLike rock stars, asteroids have been given their fair share of urban myth and lore. Many have attributed the extinction of the dinosaurs to the impact of a huge asteroid on the earth. This theory has some credibility and, if it is true, it evokes some pretty startling images and foreboding fears in the current reining species on earth, the human race.\nThe fact that asteroids are fast moving space debris only makes their movement and activity more interesting and exciting. Unlike a moon, planet or star, the odds that an asteroid could hit the earth are entirely reasonable and in fact, there are many documented cases of small asteroids making it through our atmosphere and leaving some pretty impressive craters in the earth’s surface.\nPopular culture has happily embraced the idea of an asteroid impact. The idea has spawned many a science fiction story adding the idea that alien life forms may ride asteroids to our world and start a “war of the worlds” situation. But by far, the most talked about concept that has captured the imagination and the fears of science fiction fans and the general public is of another asteroid hitting the earth that could wipe out life as allegedly happened to the dinosaurs. In fact, the movie “Armageddon” was based on this idea and the concept that somehow mankind could avert that catastrophe with technology.\nBut probably the best way to calm our fears and replace science fiction with science is with understanding and knowledge. The truth is, there has been a lot of study of asteroid activity and the serious scientific community has gained significant knowledge of these amazing celestial bodies. A number of probes to asteroids have been conducted which have given us a wealth of information about their composition and how we might predict their behavior.\nWe now know that the majority of asteroids we get to witness come from an asteroid belt that exists between Mars and Jupiter. It is from this community of asteroids that many of the notable asteroids emerged. Scientists have gained significant knowledge about the composition of asteroids and separated them into classes including class S which comes of the part of the belt that is closest to Mars, classes C, D and V which are classified by composition and a class called “Centaurs” whose flight patterns take them closer to Jupiter and Uranus.\nSome of the probes NASA has conducted on near flying asteroids have performed some pretty amazing studies of these eccentric celestial bodies. In 1994 the Galileo probe got within 1000 miles of the asteroid Ida and discovered that Ida actually had its own moon.\nOther probes have fired impactors into asteroids and even landed on an asteroid to produce some amazing scientific data for us. There is much to learn about asteroids in our love of astronomy and that knowledge only makes our enjoyment of seeing them in the cosmos even more exciting.\n- ► 2011 (578)\n- 40 glocc talkin money contracts hits on his head\n- Exclusive: Sheek Louch Speaks On Beef With 50 Cent...\n- Swizz Beatz Talks About His Partnership With Reebo...\n- Luke Campbell Lands Assistant Coach Job For Miami ...\n- 1 1/2 YEAR OLD BOY SHOT TO DEATH!!\n- Kobe's Reverse Bucket in Traffic\n- Lil Kim Fires Back At Nicki Minaj With New Diss So...\n- Jamie Foxx's ‘Best Night Of My Life' Cover Art And...\n- The Google Tablet: Head to Head with Apple?\n- Pimp C - True Story\n- 7\" NETBOOK - 300MHZ / 128MB RAM / 2GB HD / WINDOWS...\n- HOOD RAT BABIE DOLL LOL\n- BUY THE RULES & THE GAME EBOOK NOW ITS OFFICALY RE...\n- NEW TELL ALL EBOOK COUNT DOWN HERES THE COVER ON S...\n- T.I.

{"text": "Lately Mat and I have been enjoying our meals using tamarind. What is Tamarind? Would you believe a fruit that originated in Africa used in savoury dishes?\nThis is the particular brand we’re using:\nHere are the different forms you can find:\nFrom the Clovegarden.com:\nTamarind pulp is widely sold in several forms, as illustrated in the photo above:\n- Whole Pods: These are found piled in bins (mostly broken) in markets serving Hispanic communities, and carefully packed in windowed gift boxes for sale in Asian communities. This is the least convenient form as you must pick off the fragile shell before using. Otherwise prepare the same as for the block form but use a bit more to compensate for the seeds.\n- Pressed Block: This is the most common form – pulp with the shell and most of the seeds removed. Thailand is the most common exporter but also India and other tropical countries.\n- Concentrate (Regular Paste): Widely available and the most convenient form, you need only spoon it out of a jar. A tablespoon of this paste is roughly equivalent to a tablespoon of block soaked and strained. Thailand exports a number of brands, often labeled in incomprehensible Thai script and in Vietnamese as Nuoc Me Cha. They vary in quality (some have tiny bits of shell in them but this doesn’t seem to bother most recipes). A major brand from India is Laxmi which is the best I’ve used.\n- Concentrate (Black) This seems to comes only from India. The most common brand in the US is Tamicon but there are others. It is highly concentrated and clearly has been cooked down giving it a bit of a molasses flavor. You’d need to dilute it with 2 parts water to 1 part concentrate to get it about where the regular paste is, but the flavor will still be different.\nMainly, my experiences with tamarind have been with Thai dishes. We’ve been making coconut curry pad Thai, fried rice noodles with tamarind marinated vegetables, and we’re looking for more recipes to incorporate into our rotation.\n“Tamarind is the seed pods from the tamarind tree. It is widely used to provide a sweet and tart flavour to savoury meat and vegetable dishes and in drinks and deserts in South Asia. India is the top producer, growing tamarind in orchard-like plantations for domestic use and export.\nSweet and sour\nTamarind is the brown, tart flesh from the pods of a tree in the pea and bean family. The flesh surrounds the brown shiny seeds within the sausage-shaped pod. Pods are harvested at different stages of maturity according to their intended use.\nExtracts from tamarind seeds are used as a stabilising agent in some ice creams.\nTamarind pods contain compounds which have recently been found to increase people’s resistance to infections.\nIn Orissa, India, a gum is prepared from ground tamarind seeds and spread onto cloth to prepare a base for making traditional folk paintings. Tamarind plants are also used to make dyes, glue, polish carvings and buildings.”\nTamarind is incredibly tasty and has a subtle flavour that is neither sweet, nor sour, but has this in between just perfect appeal. I highly suggest you try it for yourself.\nHere are some easy recipes using tamarind:\nFairly easy Pad Thai Sauce:"}

{"text": "As a child I mourned the loss of frontiers. It seemed to me that there were no adventures into the completely unknown left, nothing where you met challenges never before encountered. During my career as a physician and especially during my fifteen years at Joseph’s House (our hospice for the homeless), however, I began to recognize the last stages of death as a true adventure into the unknown, a frontier that never disappeared. It’s not that no one has ever died before, of course, but no one has returned to give us a map, so in our own dying each of us enters into the unknown.\nAlzheimer’s, too, is an adventure, the last stages of which are shrouded in mystery, and each of us with this disease will explore an unknown wilderness. There are lots of people who’ve gone this way before, of course. Of the 40 million US residents over age 65, almost 5 million have Alzheimer’s. And although I write this blog to dispel some of the mystery, ultimately neither will I be able to tell others what the last stages are like. In a recent post I wondered whether I’ll be conscious toward the end when I appear to be completely out of it and, if not, what it will be like. We don’t know.\nMy using the word “adventure” to describe my journey into the darkness might seem like a form of semantic denial, soft-peddling the likelihood of future suffering for me and people close to me. I don’t believe I’m in denial, but even if I were, does that change the reality that this process will be an adventure?\nPerhaps we don’t think of Alzheimer’s as an adventure because we want happy endings and believe that the word “adventure” applies only to successful adventures, where the hero faces enormous dangers and suffering but eventually returns to tell the exciting story. But what if the hero does not return from the mountain; or does, but without having reached the top; or does reach the top and returns, but emotionally scarred or physically damaged? Was it any less an adventure?\nI’m grateful that I can still sense an excitement. Growing up, I felt cheated of uncharted territory. But each of us with this disease must explore it for the first time; each of us faces a unique adventure."}
{"text": "Housing group continues mission of pioneering black developer\nRiley Group aims at affordable homes in low-income part of Southeast Seattle\nUpdated 10:00 pm, Thursday, December 27, 2007\nThey dispatched Riley to Washington Territory, where he acquired four blocks in what is now Beacon Hill and 67 acres in Tacoma -- land that became the Hilltop neighborhood and the basis for Tacoma's African-American community, according to Blackpast.org, a local Web site that chronicles African-American history.\n\"We're talking about very, very small towns (then), so he's really getting in on the ground floor,\" said Quintard Taylor, an American history professor at the University of Washington and the man behind Blackpast.org.\nThe association was known not only for its predominance of African-Americans, but also because it was interracial and included two women, Taylor noted.\nThree years ago, another assemblage of African-Americans dedicated a new development effort in southeast Seattle to Riley, creating the George P. Riley Group.\nThe Riley Group came about as the economic development arm of the Breakfast Group, an organization of professional African-American men focusing on helping some of Seattle's most at-risk young men.\n\"Part of our mission was to see if we couldn't create more businesses in our communities,\" said Herman McKinney, 69, a Breakfast Group board member and chairman of its economic development committee.\nThey decided to focus on housing and expanded from an original dozen Breakfast Group members to 21, adding more professionals. Taylor joined because he saw the mission as historic.\nThe group was going to be named the Breakfast Group Development Corp. until Taylor told them about Riley.\n\"He's a guy who was attempting to do what we are now trying to do,\" he said.\nThe Riley Group's first dozen homes, in the Rainier Vista community, are not reserved for low-income buyers or African-Americans, but they do sell for less than most other new Seattle houses and are in a neighborhood where many low-income African-Americans live.\n\"We're creating jobs,\" McKinney said. \"We're creating more opportunities for businesses and housing, which is critically important.\"\nThere's also significance to having a group of African-Americans building these homes, Taylor said. \"It's about building a role model for African-Americans, particularly African-American men.\"\nThe group includes real estate professionals as well as people from other backgrounds, such as Taylor and NBA Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens. Mel Streeter, who launched Seattle's first African-American-owned architecture firm in 1967, was the group's original architect. Donald King, president and chief executive of the firm DKA, took over as project manager last year, after Streeter died.\nThe Seattle Housing Authority prefers to hire people from the communities it serves and use small, local contractors, Executive Director Tom Tierney said. \"But we've not had a group like the Riley Group before, who could actually come together and do a significant amount of our housing and at the same time create the community and social benefit.\"\nThere may be a few unfortunate parallels between the historical Riley and the modern-day group.\nMany who bought from the original Riley ended up losing their homes because of economic busts and foreclosure, Taylor said. \"It's sort of like the subprime mortgage scandal now.\"\nThe subprime scandal has contributed to slowing sales nationally and led to tighter standards among lenders who give mortgages to people with poor credit.\n\"Housing sales are going much slower than we had planned,\" Taylor said.\nIt didn't help that the first homes hit the market five months later than the group had planned, putting their debut in September, after the market had started slowing and lenders had tightened credit.\nTierney said the delay might have hurt sales, but the developer met its obligations to the authority.\n\"There was, frankly, some concern at the very beginning that they wouldn't be able to meet milestones, and that, I think, there were people wondering whether this would actually end up in quality housing on the site,\" he said. \"Our organization is tremendously impressed with what they've accomplished.\"\nThe group plans to erect more homes in Rainier Vista and then build elsewhere, McKinney said.\n\"There are so many people in our urban communities that are paying an enormous amount in rent. It just seems appropriate to be able to provide opportunities for them to purchase houses.\""}

This is unacceptable with over 60 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse in the United States affecting 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 7 boys.\nToday ABC 6 reported the General Assembly has approved Erin's Law. Rhode Island makes the 18th state to adopt Erin's Law. This legislation is to establish a school program that provides age appropriate courses in efforts to prevent child abduction, childhood sexual abuse and childhood sexual exploitation.\nThe law is named after Erin Merryn of Illinois. Merryn was only 6 years old when she was sexually abused by a neighbor and then again at the age of 11 by her cousin lasting for two years. Like most children, Merryn remained silent for years.\n\"These men may have stolen my innocence, may have taken my trust, but the one thing I've reclaimed from both of them is my voice,\" she said.\nThe bill requires students between kindergarten and eighth grade to receive education on sexual abuse and assault awareness to create prevention.\nMerryn says \"New York has been the most difficult state to get her law passed. It passes in the New York State Senate, then is referred to the Assembly Education Committee, where it eventually dies.\"\nMerryn never received sexual abuse education in school and she believes if she had it may have made a difference. Merryn's life journey has inspired her to put a face and voice on childhood sexual abuse. Her mission is to take the stigma and shame off child sexual abuse survivors and give them a voice and a reason to speak out. To educate the public that children are being abused in your own backyards. She is at war against this silent evil that is lurking in the shadows.\n\"I feel if someone had come into the classroom, the same way the police officer taught us for six weeks how to say no to drugs, it would have given me the courage to speak up and tell somebody,\" Merryn explained.\nMerryn his well known for her crusade to get Erin's Law passed. This law is intended to prevent child sexual abuse by educating children in a child friendly manner at school. She has dedicated her life to getting Erin's Law passed in all 50 states. Merryn has appeared on several national talk shows advocating for sexual abuse survivors, including The Oprah Winfrey Show. She has also written several books on the subject, and united with Michigan non-profit organization Dreamcatchers for Abused Children to create a handbook titled \"Silent Screams\" on the subject.\nIn her home state of Illinois, she convinced the legislature to create a special task force to tackle the problem of childhood sexual abuse prevention. Erin's Law was passed in Illinois in 2013, and since 14 other states have passed the law as well.\nMerryn sat down with me on Dreamcatchers Talk Radio.

According to author Edred Thorsson, if you are interested in living a holistic life with unity of body-mind-spirit, a key to knowing your spiritual heritage is found in the heritage of your body-in the natural features which you have inherited from your distant ancestors. Most readers of this book already \"speak the language\" of the Teutonic tradition.\nNorthern Magic contains material that has never before been discussed in a practical way. This book outlines the ways of Northern magic and the character of the Northern magician.

{"text": "Symbian 9 - What's it All About?\nSo the next version of Symbian OS (version 9) is here, and there have been mixed reactions ranging from it is a really really good thing, to it being a bad thing for Enterprise markets, and the greatest danger to the Developer Community since sliced bread. Let’s say that all of those viewpoints are equally wrong and right.\nHere’s something that is definitely true. Symbian OS has lots of nice new things that Symbian are very excited about in a good way. A lot of the changes that I suspect they’ve been thinking about for some time are now in the Operating System. Let’s start with the version number. There’s been a certain amount of mystique in mobile circles to see a major version number (such as 8.x to 9.x) as a fundamental change in the Operating System, something that only happens every two to three years. And while there are some major changes in OS 9, Symbian are now going to settle down to constantly improving the OS and we should see minor and incremental releases only a few months apart. This makes sense when you consider how fast the phone models change and go out of date.\nThe technical details have been talked about in great depth elsewhere, but one thing to point out is that the switch to using the ARM ABI (Application Binary Interface) means that planned updates in the ARM core architecture will allow Symbian OS to take on board the speed advantages offered in newer ARM chips.\nProbably the biggest change in the eye of the consumer is the break in binary compatibility. This means that programs written in C++ for previous versions of Symbian OS will not run on OS 9 without the original authors making a few changes to the source code and recompiling. So your Series 60 version 3 device (which will use Symbian OS 9) won’t run current Series 60 version 2 applications. The good news is that altering applications isn’t a huge amount of work – the bad news is that you’re going to have to be very careful which version of an application that you download. Expect every website to have a number of pictures of your phone, rather than a huge list of acronyms and numbers that you’ll need to match up – something the larger stores such as Handango and Motricity can cope with, but an area the part time developer will have to watch out for.\nI think this is an area Symbian should be able to do a bit more in to help the end-user (even though the end-user was never mentioned in their press release for OS 9!). The SIS format can handle storing multiple versions of an application, and run small macro-like applications when installed to determine which version to use. There’s space here for an enterprising author to work out an auto delivery SIS file, which determines which platform it is installing to and installs the correct core modules either from inside the SIS, or goes back online to grab just the correct version. If Palm OS can do this when they updated the .prc format to .psi (Palm Software Install), why can’t Symbian? That should get round what could be a confusing problem. Anything raising the barrier of entry to third party software is not good.\nBut beyond that, there are a huge number of changes under the hood that should allow the handset manufacturers to deliver better phones. The IMAP changes to the underlying email support are long overdue, and should help those accessing corporate email boxes. There is more support for multimedia files (audio and video) and Symbian have made explicit the support for the OMA DRM. Now I’m not a fan at all of DRM in any format (we’d never have guessed – Rafe), but it’s now up to the networks and content delivery sites to decide if locked down DRM content or open and transferable content will have a greater appeal in the marketplace. And while the original N-Gage had a form of USB connectivity written by Nokia, Symbian OS devices will now support being seen as a USB Mass Storage device. If this is used as an alternative option to the PC Suites bundled with the phones, so much the better.\nProbably the biggest change is at the security level. Previously, once an application was installed on your phone, it had full access to all the API’s in the OS (an API is like an index of functions a program can call. Sending an SMS would involve making an SMS API call for example). Now, applications do not have automatic access to all the API’s. Those involving critical functions (or which could run up your mobile bill) will now be restricted.\nIf your application is Symbian Signed, then the application will have full access to the API’s. If it is not signed, then the application on its own will not be able to call these API’s. Instead, the user will receive a prompt along the lines of “This Application Would Like to send an SMS. Give it permission to do so… Yes / No.” So the worry of a trojan dialler of Premium SMS application sneaking into your phone and running up your bill will only be possible if you give it permission to do so, and after you’ve also given permission for an ‘unsigned’ application to be installed. For applications you do trust that are unsigned, you can give them permission ahead of time in the new Applications Manager, and you won’t be pestered by the permission requests. This is much like the current security model for Java MIDP on some Symbian powered phones.\nOf course all this assumes that the end-user is sensible enough to say no when something suspicious happens and permission is asked for a program called ‘Make.Money.A’ to send twenty SMS messages. Given that the malware (such as Caribe) currently making headlines can only spread with the explicit permission of the user, I’m not sure whether this will be enough. Hopefully though, there will come a point when networks realise that the protection offered by Symbian OS 9.0 has probably struck the correct balance between paranoia and practicality.\nSymbian were using a lovely metaphor at 3GSM to describe the security changes. If you imagine your phone as a house (bear with me here) then the previous security was akin to a bouncer on a door, who simply shouted “someone wants in, shall I let them?” Once they’re in, though, they have full access to every room of the house (ie every API and call and system function). Symbian Signed’s purpose, of identifying where apps come from, means the bouncer can now say “Steve Litchfield wants in, shall I let him?”\nWhat the new OS does is put a Bouncer on the front door, and every other door in the house that leads to a room/API. If an application is Symbian Signed, then it’s like a golden ticket. They still need to be invited through the front door, but by showing the Symbian Signed certificate at each API, they can have access. What happens when a program isn’t Symbian Signed is actually up to the handset manufacturers and networks. There is a facility for each Bouncer to ask the user if a program can get access to an API whenever it tries to use it (eg “Can this app send an SMS”), or the Bouncer could say “Network says No” and reject access to the network for example.\nSymbian OS 9 offers the manufacturers and operators various options to put in the new handsets, so effectively it’s not actually their decision, even though they’ve programmed the tool. When the first OS 9 based handsets come out (and that’s likely to be the 6680 and variants in Q2-Q3 2005) we’ll be able to see the stance that everyone will be taking on this rather hot issue.\nIn summary though, getting excited over a new version of the Operating System is all well and good, but it’s going to come down to what phones are made that OS 9 will run on, and how they perform in the wild. That’s the true test…\nThe reaction to Symbian OS 9 has been something of a storm in a teacup. Within the small circle of Symbian and mobile media watchers there have been a few rasied eyebrows, but there were no major suprises. Symbian 9.1, together with Series 60 version 3 and UIQ 3, represent the biggest mobile OS milestone of the last few years. Among the wider IT media there has been only limited interest, and some misguided commentary. When you consider that this is a major revision to the market leading mobile device OS and it's user interfaces this might be something of a suprise. However it is more a reflection of the philsophy that the OS doesn't matter to the end user. Those that need to know about are aware of the changes and leading developers are already working with Symbian 9, Series 60 version 3 and UIQ version 3. That doesn't mean there is no interest for end user, what it does mean is that this is not about the end user. It is about the device manufacturers, the developers and the networks.\nThe fact that OS 9.1 got announced along with version 3 of the two biggest Symbian UI's is obvisouly no coincidence. Speaking to all three camps it is clear there was an element of common strategy and the consensus was that if it was going to be necessary to put the developers through extra work it should happen all at once and this is precisely what has happened. That in itself is an important commentary on the Symbian ecosystem and the way it operates. By having all three changes happen at once there are many millions saved in software development and support costs.\nThe new security models have received the most attention and the most criticism. There is a natural reaction from end users to not want anything limiting, but this is what it comes down to. If this model (essentially securing sensitive parts of the OS by a challenge response system) is not implemented the smart mobile device market will cease to exist. Why? Partly it is a question of the networks - they simply will not let insecure devices onto their networks. Networks have a far greater level of control over access to their network than say an ISP does to your access to the Internet. The networks are concerned that they're infrastructure could be pulled down by traffics surges (think SMS delivery on New Years Eve), or that customers might get upset by unexpected charges. But it is more than that, as one commentator put it to me:\n\"These devices are as powerful as 5 year old computers and often more sophisticated. They have an always on connection. Look at the problems on the 'desktop' Internet [with mal traffic, fraud, spam etc.]. The thought of that within the context of mobile infrastructure is scary. We might not see the threat now, but we have to plan for it now.\"\nIt is no secret that each of the major mobile OS are looking to do exactly the same thing, and for some of them it is a big headache. Speaking to an anti-virus vendor he commented that he felt Symbian was relatively secure:\n\"Symbian OS is more secure. It is receiving the attention because there are more Symbian devices [in the market]. We had a lot of trouble creating a hook into the OS [for the anti virus engine], we had to ask Symbian for help. Contrasting that with other platforms we had several choices of how to hook in, there are more holes. The problem is overhyped on Symbian, you want to watching the other platforms in my opinion.\"\nSymbian, as market leader in numbers and technology, are unsurpisingly the first to market with a stronger security model tightly integrated into the OS. In essence there is an inevitablity about these changes, and rather than greeting them with reluctance we should be celebrating the foresight.\nClearly though it is important to realise that the chnage has implications. The smaller and hobbyist developers may not be able to afford to get their programs Symbian Signed. Even the larger developers admit Symbian signed is a \"colossal pain\". The price of signing is coming down all the time and that should be encouraged, but Symbian and its licensees need to look at ways to facillitate the smooth implementation of the new reigeme as much as possible. A big part of that is going to be communication, something which thus far has been handled fairly poorly.\nSymbian: Symbian OS v9 Technology Page, Symbian OS 9.1 - 2 Page Product Description, Symbian OS 9.1 - deatiled functional description\nSymbianOne: New Opportunities, New Challenges\nTheFeature: When is your phone no longer yours?"}
{"text": "An email may be the simplest form of communication between businesses, but it’s not taken that seriously as it should be. Many-a-times, it’s written in more of a robotic tone that transcribes into nothing. This tone often abandons the conversation. It finishes the urge to respond or carry the conversation further. Yes, it’s not that simple as you think it is. Sometimes, it depends on the kind of mindset with which you draft one.\nNow, the real intent of writing this one is to elaborate on things that can make you sound real and convincing over an email. There’s actually a lot that can happen over emails. Do pass-by the following to make yourself prepared for the next mail you’d write -\nHave a motive in your mind\nYou are gonna send that email to your recipient for them to make a decision or something which you would want them to act upon. Your mind has to be clear before you pen down your thoughts.\nGet yourself to answer, what action would you want the receiver to take. You don’t have to be vague while doing that. It is just the opposite of useful, if you’re vague. Keep your mind clear and welcome the thoughts that want to barge-in. And please, don’t make it sound machine-like. Conversational style is what most look for out there.\nConclude in the beginning\nDon’t be jaw dropped when I ask you to do that. This is recommended. You must have been taught to write introduction in the beginning, but you should try doing the opposite instead. Conclude in the beginning to feed the recipient about the entire email ingredients.\nIf they are not told the immediate reason for the mail, don’t expect them to go through the entire piece. Nobody has the time to do that. They’ll probably walk over. For example, if you want to ask for some concession on a service, just ask for it. Do not sit back to write the entire story about how you are suffering financially or anything for that matter.\nSimply ask for it, like this – Need x% concession on ‘whatever’. Do not beat around the bush.\nLook Smarter in the Subject Line\nI have this habit of scrapping subject lines one after another. I just can’t seem to get it right in the first or second instance. The reason why I constantly spend a lot of time thinking about the right subject line is because it would decide my email’s fate. The subject line makes one either open it or never bother it. In my case, I would want the latter to happen.\nAnd I mostly write the subject line, after writing the entire mail, i.e.after giving all the possible arguments and conclusions. So, you got to get a couple of tasks accomplished here-\n- strike the curious nerve\n– conclude within\nAgain, it’s easier said than done, but you have no option whatsoever other than making it happen.\nThe last line of the email brings the recipient to take an action. It’s all human psychology. Final things said, tend to have a much stronger impact than the ones said before. A recipient seeks a direction after reading your mail and this last conclusive statement can provide the much needed one. Hope you’re now all set to draft one.. Go ahead !!"}

Throughout the 1990–2009 period, the financial activities supersector was the single largest contributor to New York City's wage base. In 2009, this supersector alone accounted for 30 percent of the City's total wages. Employment in the financial activities supersector decreased from 507,241 to 426,660 over the period, a loss of 16 percent of its employment.\nEmployment in professional and business services in New York City grew from 474,743 to 550,036 over the 1990–2009 period. Average professional and business services supersector wages rose faster in New York City (from $40,665 to $91,489) than in the nation as a whole.\nEducation and health accounted for an increasing share of employment in New York City. Employment in education and health services grew from 457,465 to 701,754 from 1990 to 2009, as average annual wages increased from $26,332 to $47,843.\nUnlike education and health services, the trade, transportation, and utilities supersector experienced a net loss in employment as its employment level declined 8 percent from 1990 to 2009; average annual wages increased from $30,010 to $48,005 over the same period.\nGovernment employment (federal, state, and local combined) in New York City declined 7 percent over the period studied, compared to an employment growth rate of 2.3 percent for all industries combined.\nNew York City's pay premium—the percent by which people who work in the combined five counties of New York City were paid above the national average—rose substantially between 1990 and 2009.

{"text": "Gratiot County’s Board of Commissioners is considering the purchase of 10 acres adjacent to the Gratiot County Landfill.\nThe possibility of someone suing the county due to the contamination is the driving force for the purchase.\nThe 40 acre landfill was opened in 1971 and used for domestic, commercial and industrial waste. Nearly 270,000 pounds of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) were dumped there, along with other toxic chemicals and waste.\nLocated southeast of St. Louis, it’s one of the area’s Superfund sites.\nSeveral kinds of clean ups were begun through the years, with the later attempts appearing successful in containing the contamination so it doesn’t spread.\nThe state was in charge of the clean up but it has returned the landfill to the county, which is now responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of the site.\nRepresentatives from Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality have asked the county if it wants to purchase the adjacent 10 acres.\nFormer Pine River Task Force Chair Jane Keon, who was recently appointed interim commissioner for District 4, suggested that the county buy the property.\n“(The adjacent 10 acres) has already been breached,” she said. “If it should happen again, I don’t want the county to be sued.”\nAnd, she said she was told that there are other interested buyers.\nCost is expected to be about $1,000 or so for the acreage, said County Administrator Jeff Huff.\nCommissioner John Renneberg said however, that a letter written to the buyer, outlining the possible contamination - “buyer beware” - should protect the county.\n“It’s not a problem,” he said.\nBut Keon, who had been asked to examine the site with a representative of the DEQ, explained that, “This is serious contamination.

{"text": "By Allison Benis White\nCleveland State U Press, 2009\nPaperback, 63 pages\nReviewed by Kathryn Stevenson\nAbove all, Allison Benis White’s collection of poems Self-Portrait with Crayon teaches us the simple, unforgettable maxim: pain is reach.\nThe collection begins with what is gone: “The hidden are alone too. I crouched in the closet, between my mother’s skirts and shoes, where the legs should be” (5). Without a body, clothes outline lack, their shapes marking boundaries between body and disembodiment: “The shoulders are the span of the hanger and the mind is the hook which suspends the entire dress” (5). The image of the mind reduced to a hook does not speak of pain, but we get it.\nHere, the thing gestures toward an idea, a non-thing, one cannot otherwise hold. In this sense, the thing—a closet, a dress, a hanger—allows connection, a sudden narrative snap: “People lose their minds and leave in the middle of cooking salmon” (5). This reach—the move to connect loss to a moment, a kitchen, the smell of a pink-bodied fish—rises from the compulsion to anchor ourselves in the material world, ground ourselves in the sediment of objects, and attach to some small, real thing before we are capable of consolation: “I will tell you something quietly: we tried to send her a birthday card, but it was returned, wrong address. It is common to know very little, if anything” (5).\nA salmon dinner, a birthday card, a wrong address—these are the cold, hard things that punch, punctuating our otherwise amorphous and mass-less despair. Yet they are the details that allow us to articulate and imagine—here, though, sketch—what is otherwise unspeakable and unimaginable. White knows grief calls on us to represent loss in the details, to perceive boundaries between the ordinary and extraordinary, to sketch rather than bullet, to reject chronology, to begin in the middle, and, yet to tell anyway, to narrate and discern and forge universals out of abstraction, to find yet another thing that might, finally, point at what to do next or what to avoid or what, simply, to accept: “People exist for as long as possible until it is too difficult to matter” (5).\nOn its own, the collection’s first poem “From Degas’ Sketchbook” offers the image of how difficult it is for a girl hidden in her mother’s closet to matter to someone gone and, simultaneously, how difficult for a mother “to matter”—both in the sense of being worthy or recognized worthy and in the sense of materializing, coming into being to embody the articles that, to a closeted, crouched child represent lack. Somehow, at once, a mother mothers as long as she can, and a daughter recalls her until it is too painful or too cumbersome even to conjure her in images, to bring back someone gone. Here, grief is a central interior impulse that reaches out, like the motion of a hand drawn to touch something untouchable before it retracts, repelled.\nTogether, the poems in Self-Portrait with Crayon are a study in mourning and melancholia, a grammatology of sadness—one which outlines the features of despair, the rules of mourning, and the shape of our efforts to live through it.\nDespair, White understands, opens eyes to the things before us with an urgency that shackles us to images that might have otherwise been fleeting, like a cruel time machine in which there is no travel, only the unending awareness of time and an acute sense that past, present, and future are tidy, irrelevant categories that mislead, distract, and relieve those not mourning. Like this: “If I press my hand against the window, no one will die sooner or reverse directions” (8). Or this: “Before I was born, my dog buried a plastic frog in the side yard when one of her female puppies died—she needed somewhere” (9). We are not safe from what already came or what has yet to come; any minute we might feel every loss all at once—and not just our own, but through ours, we’ll feel the loss of others as well. And so we must attach loss, freeze it, give it “somewhere.”\nFrom White’s poems, readers can glean recognizable, patterned responses to loss; mourning forces our focus on the particulars, for instance—which is to say that people mourning know what is not nothing: “I want to reach things I can keep” (54). Like wounded dogs, they need objects—to attach, to express themselves, to project meaning onto, to represent—as if to re-imagine or retool or redesign the shape of the interior, driving, unsettled mind.\nPeople mourning outline impressions even as they suffer imprint: “When there is nothing left, everything is possible” (26). Or, perhaps it is that they deal with imprint by outlining impressions, as if to cast imprint off. In “Interior of the Rape,” for instance, White’s cutting characterization of human bonding is so sharply resonant it is, one moment, beautiful: “I will not let you sleep follows the pattern of most affection”; a step later, though, she tugs at the pattern’s brutality instead: “This is the feeling of a leash at the base of your neck” (25).\nPeople mourning grasp for universals among the particulars: “We will live as long as we have someone to tell” (26). The reach for human patterns is the effort to seek solace in the omnipresence of pain, to find dull, pain-diffusing, trauma-abating normalcy in suffering—like this: “It is common to rock the sick in your arms. It is common to rearrange the body into a comfortable position” (23). And this: “It would be unnatural to place the arms at the sides, torso unprotected” (23).\nUnderstanding fear overcomes us, White sometimes offers the patterns as instruction: “when you enter someone else’s room, it is important to whisper her name before you touch her, so she knows you are approaching, and does not become alarmed” and “If someone breaks into your house at night, my father advised, pretend you are dead” (28; 24). Here, advice exposes everyone—those who might break in, those who fear them, those who cannot do more than recommend we play dead. Readers sense White does not endorse an action more than she scorns our resignation to fear—ambivalently, though, while representing the lives of people who live by it.\nPeople mourning consider what will be gone soon: “Whether we miss less what we know will disappear, I am tired of seeing” and “A sponge attached to a hand which is attached to an arm. Which is crucial. Anxiety thrives on the unknown. If her hand took the sponge away, there would be a cool empty spot on the child’s neck” (41). The move to reflect on what is here now but soon might not be is an exercise in taking the part away from the whole so that one might imagine another scenario and thus come to know the unknown—to treat anxiety with anticipation, essentially. Lives marked by a history of hard times know leaning on the cool-headed expectation that the worst is coming makes life better now. Because it means we will be less anxious and more prepared.\nIn “Horse with Jockey,” someone points “to an X-ray of his chest,” saying, “The human heart is an apple,” and someone else asks, “But what shape or comfort can I make with my mind?” Self-Portrait with Crayon is one.\nAllison Benis White's poems have appeared in The Iowa Review, Ploughshares, and Pleiades, among other journals.

All denominations are in Tongan pa‘anga, which is currently worth about half a United States dollar. An aerial view of St. Peter’s Basilica and of St. Peter’s Square appears in the background of the souvenir sheet.\nWhile flying from Auckland, New Zealand, t0 Nuku‘alofa, Tonga, recently, I noticed that Cardinal Mafi and two assistants were aboard. He really is as young as he looks on these stamps and appears to have a long and fruitful ministry ahead of him.\nThese stamps certainly qualify for religion, Catholic, cardinals, Pope Francis, popes, Vatican City and St. Peter’s Basilica and Square categories when forming topical or themed collections. Topical collections are very popular among philatelists. Apart from that, the Cardinal Mafi commemoratives are brightly colored and will make a nice addition to your collection, whether you collect by country, by topic or by whatever strikes your fancy.\nThe Kingdom of Tonga has a population of about 105,000 and is spread over 700,000 square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. It’s inhabitants speak Tongan, a Polynesian language; many Tongans are also fluent in English. Both Tongan and English are official languages in the Kingdom. Tongans live on about 40 islands out of a total of some 170 and rely on agriculture, fishing and tourism for their livlihoods.\nI’m surprised that stocks of the Cardinal Mafi commemorative stamps are still available at essentially face value a year after their release.

Top of line corrosion is limited by the amount of iron that can dissolve in the condensed water, and acetic acid increases the corrosion rate because it increases the solubility of iron in the condensing water.\nThe experimental conditions were simulated by calculations using a chemical solubility software package. The calculations showed that the solubility of iron carbonate increases with increasing acetic acid content. The calculated values fitted well with the measured values in the experiments. The calculations also showed that the saturation ratio for iron carbonate is significantly higher than for iron sulfide under these conditions. The small amounts of H2S in these experiments did not have a notable effect on the resulting corrosion rate under these conditions at 85 °C, where iron carbonate is the main corrosion product."}

{"text": "Winnowing Down the Theories\nA year after TWA 800, investigators are testing six scenarios that deal primarily with mechanical failure\nBOSTON — A Boeing 747 that screamed down the runway at New York's Kennedy International Airport on Monday carried with it high hopes that one of the most perplexing crashes in aviation history will yet be solved.\nFederal investigators are using the plane to try to re- create conditions of a fatal evening last July, when TWA Flight 800 exploded in midair, killing all 230 people on board. The tests, to be continued into next week, signal how one year later aviation experts are still looking for answers - and how determined they are to find them.\nInvestigators have known for some time that vapors in the plane's nearly empty center fuel tank exploded, ripping apart the 25-year-old jumbo jet off the coast of New York. But the biggest, costliest crash investigation to date has yielded no physical evidence to support any of the three original theories of what brought down the plane: a bomb, a missile, or a mechanical failure.\nThe crash, however, has prompted some changes in airplane-safety and airport-security practices. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates air disasters, found several problems with 747 fuel systems during this probe and recommended safety measures to prevent center fuel tanks from exploding, no matter the source of ignition. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has so far refused to order these changes, saying more tests are needed.\nEven so, suspicion that the Flight 800 crash was the work of terrorists led four airports to add high-tech explosive-detection devices - and 50 more devices will be installed at other airports in coming months. A few airports, too, now use a passenger-profiling system to help identify suspected terrorists, and the FAA is testing a system to \"match\" passengers with luggage.\nNow, in the absence of forensic evidence, it's looking less likely that a terrorist missile or bomb destroyed the plane. But scientists have narrowed possible mechanical ignition sources (see box, right), and they are designing more tests to determine if any could produce a blast powerful enough to rip apart a 170-ton airplane.\n\"We have made a great deal of progress,\" says NTSB chairman Jim Hall. \"We have been able to narrow the investigation down to five or six different scenarios, and I am confident we will ... finally determine the ignition source.\"\nIn this week's tests at Kennedy Airport, a big Boeing 747 sat for a few hours on the tarmac, revving its engines and running its air-conditioning units. Then it barreled down the runway, miming the precise conditions under which Flight 800 took off.\nThe tests performed to date and those being set up are time-consuming and can lead to explosions, says Mr. Hall. He hopes the tests will end by December, when the NTSB plans to hold public hearings in Baltimore. It may be another year before investigators reach a final conclusion, he says.\nThe TWA probe is the first time the NTSB and FBI have collaborated. Both agencies claim the process has been smooth, but critics question whether having two investigative agencies - one intent solely on determining if a crime occurred - hampered the investigation at the outset.\nAviation experts say solving the crash is vital because 1,000 of the venerable 747s - first produced in 1969 - are still flying. \"It is critically important that the investigation be thorough and that the conclusions be supportable beyond any doubt for the benefit of aviation safety,\" says Aaron Gellman, director of the Transportation Center at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\nTo be sure, the scope of this joint investigation has been exhaustive. For months, Navy divers scoured the ocean floor near Long Island, fishing thousands of parts from the depths. Trawlers dragged a 40-square-mile section of the ocean bottom. Investigators built a 94-foot mock-up of the plane from the center fuel tank to the cockpit. Hundreds of investigators swarmed over parts, searching for clues. Laboratories across the US and in England have run chemical and metallurgical tests.\nThe FBI, which took the initial lead in the investigation, is now near to pulling out. Its intelligence sources - human and electronic - have turned up no evidence of foul play. No forensic evidence has been collected to support either the bomb or missile theories.\nLATEST IDEAS ON WHY IT CRASHED\nThe NTSB has found causes for all but four crashes it's investigated. Here are the six theories for the TWA crash.\n* Scavenge pump. The pump wasn't found, but its manufacturer is testing whether overheating can create a spark.\n* Static electricity. Scientists are testing whether any fuel-line complications could have produced a static charge.\n* Fuel probes. Seven probes measure the fuel level in the center tank. The manufacturer is testing to see if a probe could have been ignited by a spark outside the tank.\n* Fuel tank in the wing. The FAA suspects a spark in this tank may have sent a flame through vent tubes linked to the center tank. Flight tests will explore the theory.\n* Small explosive charge. Investigators are putting explosives on a 747 in England to see if they can ignite the fuel tank. Effects of the test-charges will be compared with the damage to Flight 800.\n* High-speed particle penetration. Flight 800 might have been hit by a high-speed fragment from a nearby exploding missile, a meteorite, or space debris."}
{"text": "By Dennis Polkow\nColumbia College is honoring its first-ever full-time faculty member and the legendary founder of its music department, the late William Russo, with a two-day festival called “Celebrating William Russo: Artist & Educator.”\nA Chicago native, Russo’s influence and legacy must be measured in decades and across genres and disciplines. Having studied with pianist Lennie Tristano as a boy, Russo was composing music of his own as a teenager and soon leading jazz bands.\nAlthough Russo joined Stan Kenton’s forty-piece Innovations Orchestra as a trombonist in the early 1950s, he ushered in a pioneering style of orchestral jazz as arranger and composer for that ensemble that remains unparalleled.\nIconic Russo works such as “23 Degrees North, 82 Degrees West” and “Frank Speaking”—both of which will be performed as part of a December 7 concert of Russo’s works at the Jazz Showcase—spotlight Russo’s fascination with cross-fertilizing multiple forms.\n“People may not realize how much of a surprising and interesting influence Bill has been on American music,” assesses bluesman Corky Siegel, himself one who loves to bridge musical worlds, and who considers Russo his mentor in doing so.

I remember auditioning for the Civic Orchestra [the training orchestra of the CSO] and Adolph Herseth [longtime CSO principal trumpet] was right there, and it was like, ‘Oh, my God: I’ve got to play in front of the best there is?’ ”\nLoughnane and his band mates from Chicago did eventually make it to the stage of Ravinia at the height of the band’s initial wave of popularity in August of 1972, but have not played the venue since. Late Ravinia executive director Edward Gordon described the aftermath of that concert “as if a B52 had flown by and dropped a ton of garbage over the park.” Read the rest of this entry »\nAnthony Dominick Benedetto, aka Tony Bennett, turned 85 earlier this month (August 3) but it’s hard to think of many other octogenarians still swinging the way that Tony is.

The Welsh bass-baritone superstar has severely curtailed his American appearances and the Met has been his first priority when he does come to the States. This week Terfel makes his long-awaited return to Chicago at Ravinia, where he had several early career triumphs.\nTerfel will sing the role of Scarpia in a concert version of Puccini’s “Tosca” with soprano Patricia Racette in the title role and Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra as Cavaradossi, with Ravinia music director James Conlon conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (not the CSO chorus, however, in another Ravinia cost-cutting move).\nThe title and most popular aria (“Vissi d’arte”) may belong to Tosca, but in many ways, this is Scarpia’s opera, and Terfel is known for his blood-curdling portrayal and for the way that he toys with Tosca and creates sadistic sexual tension with her. Read the rest of this entry »\nSoprano Deborah Voigt has been singing a lot of Puccini recently at Lyric Opera, a rather dull “Tosca” two seasons ago and a shoot-’em-up Minnie in “La fanciulla del West” earlier this year. But it is Voigt’s Wagner and Richard Strauss that remain her bread-and-butter roles and, among today’s singers, in a class by themselves. Happily, this rare orchestral concert appearance will offer a compact evening of some of Voigt’s most memorable portrayals with the additional benefit of giving the CSO a chance to offer an evening of its bread-and-butter repertoire as well, under former Ravinia music director and new National Symphony Orchestra music director Christoph Eschenbach.\nFresh on Voigt’s triumph at the Met with her first-ever Brünnhilde, she reprises Sieglinde’s “Du bist der Lenz” from Act I of “Die Walküre” and offers Elizabeth’s Act II aria “Dich teure Halle” from “Tannhäuser.” Orchestral Wagner on the program includes the Overture to “Tannhäuser” and “Siegfried’s Rhine Journey” from “Götterdämmerung.”\nVoigt’s Richard Strauss will be represented by “Ich kann nicht sitzen” from “Elektra” (“Chrysothemsis’ scene”) and by the Finale of “Salome,” one of Voigt’s signature roles and some of the most rapturous music ever composed. Orchestral Richard Strauss includes the “Dance of the Seven Veils.”\nAlso on the program is the Overture to Beethoven’s “Fidelio” and Leonore’s Act I “Abscheulicher!” (Dennis Polkow)\nJuly 9, 7:30pm at Ravinia Festival, Lake-Cook & Green Bay Roads, Highland Park, (847)266-5100. $15-$70.\nIt has been seventy-five years since the Chicago Symphony Orchestra began its annual residency at the Ravinia Festival, an anniversary which is being celebrated throughout what is, ironically, one of the CSO’s most truncated at Ravinia. This week marks one of the first CSO Ravinia concerts of the summer, which sees the return of former Ravinia music director and new National Symphony Orchestra music director Christoph Eschenbach for a series of concerts.\n2011 marks the bicentennial of Franz Liszt, which Ravinia is marking all season long but especially in this opening week, where both piano concertos are being presented: No. 1 on the CSO season opening itself (July 7) with soloist Lang Lang, and tonight’s performance of the Second Piano Concerto with soloist Andre Watts. The contrast could not be more extreme: whereas Lang Lang epitomizes the kind of empty virtuosity that many stereotype Liszt as also representing, Watts has always taken a more cerebral approach and has approached Liszt as the true innovator and revolutionary that he was and in the right hands such as those of Watts, can still be. In another cost-cutting move, segments of both concerts will consist of non-orchestral solo piano pieces featuring the soloists as well, sort of built-in and pre-programmed encores: Lang will be performing Chopin, Watts will be performing Liszt.\nBerlioz’ Roman Carnival Overture will open tonight’s performance and Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” will close it out.

The long limbo that began when Daniel Barenboim abruptly left his position as longtime Chicago Symphony Orchestra music director in May of 2006 is ending, at long last. Leninesque banners of Muti dot the city proclaiming “Festa Muti,” fall arts previews all spotlight his inaugural appearances, music critics are traversing continents to cover his concerts in various languages.\nMuti is scheduled to arrive in Chicago September 15—well after press time—but the curiosity as to what the man himself is feeling as what is already being dubbed “the Muti era” actually begins here prompts us to reach out to the maestro by phone in his suburban Salzburg villa to find out. The rest of us may be excited, but Muti, as we have seen here now on numerous press announcements and conversations, can be as funny and mischievous as a schoolboy, having one Italian paper report on the constant one-liners of his last press conference here under the headline, “Un clown nommé Riccardo Muti.” Perhaps it is the mountain air—“It has been cloudy and rainy here for forty days”—but today, however, Muti is initially introspective and somber as he discusses what he calls “his last adventure” as music director.

Performances within Chicago city limits have become far fewer for the Chicago native, however, and in fact, Lewis has not played at a downtown venue in over a decade, and last appeared at the Chicago Jazz Festival over a quarter of a century ago, back in 1984.\nPerforming with longtime collaborators Larry Gray on bass and drummer Leon Joyce as part of this year’s 32nd annual festival to celebrate Lewis’ seventy-fifth birthday—which was May 27—this unusual downtown concert marks Lewis’ Millennium Park debut and is the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s first-ever free Chicago concert. “This concert is a gift to my hometown—the city that has nurtured me and inspired me my entire life,” says Lewis in a press statement. “We are thrilled to perform at the Pritzker Pavilion surrounded by the vibrancy and awe-inspiring grandeur of the most beautiful city in the world.” Read the rest of this entry »\nBecause New Zealand soprano Kiri Te Kanawa was a protégée of legendary Chicago Symphony Orchestra music director Sir Georg Solti, Chicago has heard this once-reigning diva at virtually every stage of her career. That included a gala “farewell” two years ago with the orchestra so long associated with her. As reported then, no one says it’s over until the diva says it’s over, and in this case, since Te Kanawa is still in superb voice, she is giving us something as an additional “farewell” that was a real rarity when she was in her prime: an intimate recital.\nAmong the highlights of Te Kanawa’s many performances here was the glorious Mahler Fourth that she performed and recorded here under Solti and the CSO, and no less than two performances of Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello,” –one for Solti’s seventieth birthday gala in 1987 with Placido Domingo, another alongside for the first and only time that Luciano Pavarotti ever sang the role for Solti’s own “farewell” performances as CSO music director in 1991, where Te Kanawa sat onstage traumatized by the fact that Pavarotti was attempting to camouflage eating entire chickens onstage when he wasn’t singing and was tossing the chicken bones on the floor next to her. But hey, while Te Kanawa was rehearsing for the world premiere of “Paul McCartney’s Liverpool Oratorio” at Liverpool Cathedral, she freaked out the former Beatle when she began actually scolding tourists who were in her line of sight yards away, asking them to “move along” as if she owned the place. Late and mischievous tenor Jerry Hadley thought the whole thing was hysterical and was doing his best to keep a straight face. Ah yes, they don’t make divas like this anymore.

Ravinia is loosely attempting to tie in the 200th anniversary of Mexican independence to Osorio’s heritage, but an opportunity to hear a complete Beethoven Piano Concerto cycle with a pianist of Osorio’s caliber needs no such gimmickry and is a major musical statement in and of itself.\nMozart is often credited with creating the piano concerto as we know it, but it was Beethoven who not only gave the orchestra an expanded and eventually a role equal to that of the soloist, but who made the piano concerto a more personal vehicle of self-expression and emotion, marking the transition from Classicism to Romanticism.

Alexander Autographs, one of the largest auction houses for rare historical documents and manuscripts, is offering the rare archive for a starting price of $200,000 on September 20 and 21.\n“It is the most important cache of World War II autographs to ever become available for sale. This massive historic grouping contains nearly the entire literary legacy of Joseph Goebbels, heretofore unknown to the general public,” says Bill Panagopulos, president of Alexander Autographs.\n“More importantly, it may prove invaluable in providing historical and psychological insights into the mind of Goebeles,” he adds.\nLast year, Alexander Autographs sold the diaries of notorious Auschwitz death camp Dr. Josef Mengele to a Jewish collector from the U.S., who promised to show it to the public.\nGoebbels’ archives encompass almost every aspect of his young life - from report cards, letters from family and friends, school essays, to desperate love letters and scribbling, from poetry to doctoral writings.\nThe condition of this archive is exceptional, with all materials in very good to fine condition. They remain in almost the same state as when written almost one hundred years ago. Most are in pencil, which remains clear and sharp, bindings are largely tight, correspondences are in excellent condition and most are sorted chronologically.\nGoebbels committed suicide on May 1, 1945, along with the death of his wife and children. This resulted in no direct heirs to his estate. When his papers surfaced years later, they were offered for sale to the Bundesarchiv, at which time his sister intervened to halt the transaction.\nGerman courts determined that the ownership of the papers and their copyright would be placed in the hands of a third party, Goebbels' \"literary executor.\" The papers in this archive were ordered to be given to the current consignor upon the death of that executor.\nAlongside the Goebles archive, the same auction houseoffers for sale the private archive of another Nazi figure: Otto Skorzeny, Nazi officer and Hitler's chief and favorite commando, who made a daring mountain-top rescue of Mussolini in 1943.\nAfter the war, Skorzeny headed the organization that helped hundreds of ex-SS officers flee Germany. He supported Palestinian terrorists as well, while at the same time cooperated with Mossad to expose the ex-Nazi scientists in Egypt.\nFor sale are thousands of pages of letters, documents, typescripts, notes, statements and other written and printed materials by Skorzeny.“This vast archive, never before offered at auction, undoubtedly includes important material concerning Skorzeny's \"underground\" activities, their funding, and those involved therein,” said Panagopulos.\nSkorzeny died in 1975. “we were told that the balance of Skorzeny's papers were burned shortly after his death, as Ilse, his wife, had feared recriminations from his ex-associates, as well as the CIA and Mossad”, says Panagopulos."}

The disorder is characterized by multiple developmental problems, as well as behavioral features, such as repetitive stereotypic hand movements, including hand washing, wringing, and tapping. While there is no cure for RTT, recent advances in the understanding of the disease suggest that the development of new, effective therapies is promising. This study will gather information on the genetic defects that cause RTT, the physical expressions of these defects, and disease progression.

It is usually caused by an abnormality (mutation) in the gene MECP2. RTT can cause severe impairments in movement and communication skills, including speech and social interaction. The first signs of RTT include loss of acquired speech and loss of purposeful hand use for activities such as eating or playing. Individuals may also develop abnormal walking, repetitive hand movements, such as clapping or wringing, and abnormal breathing while awake.\nEffective treatments for RTT are currently lacking. There is also inadequate information about the link between RTT clinical features and its genetic basis. In order to prepare for future clinical trials that may lead to effective therapies, it is important to collect accurate information about the characteristics of RTT and the pattern of disease progression.

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Violent crimes unexpectedly jumped 18 percent last year, the first rise in nearly 20 years, and property crimes rose for first time in a decade. But academic experts said the new government data fall short of signaling a reversal of the long decline in crime.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Wednesday that the increase in the number of violent crimes was the result of an upward swing in simple assaults, which rose 22 percent, from 4 million in 2010 to 5 million last year. The incidence of rape, sexual assault and robbery remained largely unchanged, as did serious violent crime involving weapons or injury.\nProperty crimes were up 11 percent in 2011, from 15.4 million in 2010 to 17 million, according to the bureau's annual national crime victimization survey. Household burglaries rose 14 percent, from 3.2 million to 3.6 million. The number of thefts jumped by 10 percent, from 11.6 million to 12.8 million.\nThe statistics bureau said the percentage increases last year were so large primarily because the 2011 crime totals were compared to historically low levels of crime in 2010. Violent crime has fallen by 65 percent since 1993, from 16.8 million to 5.8 million last year.\n\"2011 may be worse than 2010, but it was also the second-best in recent history,\" said Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox.\n\"These simple assaults are so low-level in severity that they are not even included in the FBI counts of serious crime,\" Fox said. FBI crime data only counts aggravated assaults.\nThe growth in violent crime experienced by whites, Hispanics, younger people and men accounted for the majority of the increase.\nChris Melde, an assistant professor at Michigan State University's school of criminal justice, said: \"you can have percentage changes that seem quite large but unless you put them in a longer-term perspective you can sometimes misinterpret the overall seriousness of the problem. I would caution against forecasting future crime trends based on a one-year fluctuation.\"\nA retired police chief says the growing number of assaults last year may reflect a need by law enforcement to spend more time and attention on what's happening in the nation's schools.\n\"My experience was that almost always, disputes started on campus and the young people took care of them off-campus with fists,\" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, the country's oldest, non-partisan, nonprofit police research organization. Bueermann was the police chief in Redlands, Calif., for 13 years.\nBueermann said the bureau's crime victimization reports can be a useful tool for police because \"you get a different snapshot that's just as valuable\" as looking at crimes which are formally reported to police.\nThe victimization figures are based on surveys by the Census Bureau of a large sample of Americans in order to gather data from those who are victims of crime. The results are considered the government's most comprehensive crime statistics because they count both crimes that never are reported to the police as well as those reported.\nHistorically, less than half of all crimes, including violent crimes, are reported to police.\nLast May, the FBI's preliminary crime report for 2011, which counts only crimes reported to police, concluded that while crime dropped again last year, the declines slowed in the last half of the year. In the FBI report, violent crime fell 6.4 percent in the first six months of last year. But for the entire year, the decline was much less, just 4 percent. The number of reported property crimes fell 3.7 percent in the first half of last year, but for all of 2011, went down just 0.8 percent.\nThe slowing of declines in the second half of last year was seen by some academic experts as a sign that the years of falling crime levels might be nearing an end.\n\"It will be fascinating to see\" the next FBI report, which comes out at the end of October, said professor Alfred Blumstein of the Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon University."}

He chose to launch a pledge fund after he saw that a number of limited partners (LPs) in the US were unhappy with India-focused funds.\nLPs are investors in a PE fund while general partners (GPs) are the managers who make deals on behalf of LPs for a fee.\n“Many Indian GPs have not been cash-conscious and invested in firms when valuations were at a peak. At the other end, there were people who were over-cautious and not done any deals at all but were earning fees on capital for doing nothing,” said Swamy.\n“The second big grievance was the lack of transparency in deal structures. LPs wanted more clarity on what deals are done and why they are done,” he added.\nEight or nine months ago, Swamy and his friends started Ananta Capital Advisors as a pledge fund, a financing vehicle that came on the scene in the US in the late-1980s.\nA pledge fund is an amalgam of a traditional venture fund and a loose grouping of individual angel investors who invest in start-ups. Investors provide capital to the fund on a deal-by-deal basis rather than putting up money upfront as is traditionally done – a fundless structure, in other words.\nIn a pledge fund, the management fee and the “carry” is calculated on the amount invested and not on the capital committed, as in the case of a regular PE firm. The “carry” is the fund manager’s share of the profits made on an investment.\nLPs are unhappy at the way things have turned out after the financial crisis, said Swamy, who serves as the managing director of Ananta Capital.\n“They are looking at models where they have more control where their money is invested,” he told Mint. “A pledge fund model fits their bill perfectly.”\nBesides pledge funds, quasi-hedge funds and warehousing are some of the other models that LPs are using to market their funds.\n“It is not just deals that are scarce, but the funds are also scarce,” said Vijay Sambamurthi, founder of Lexygen, a law firm that advises PE firms. “People who managed to raise funds in the heyday of 2007 are fine; they need to only worry about where to put their money and how to protect themselves. But people who are fundraising in this kind of market need to be innovative on both fronts.”\nLPs are the primary source of funds for PE firms, typically a mix of institutions such as insurance firms, pension funds, university endowments and high net worth individuals.\n“A pledge fund’s structure from an LP’s perspective is fairly convenient,” said Gopal Jain, a partner at PE firm Gaja Capital Partners. “They retain the discretion whether or not to participate in a particular investment.”\n“Fundless sponsors do exist, especially in the US and have been known to operate for years,” said Srinivas Chidambaram of Jacob Ballas Capital India Private Limited. “This is an opportunistic model of intermediation. It is a hit or miss model but in a free and creative world, they will always exist.”\nSeth Freeman, chief executive and chief investment officer of EM Capital Management LLC, agrees such models are common in the US, adding that the practice is actually a reversion to the way things worked before funds became popular.\nThe entry barriers for setting up such firms are low, he points out. “It takes little fixed infrastructure and overhead for the pledge fund or ‘fundless’ sponsors. It does not require much more than a telephone number and email address until a deal is found and funded. So, just about anyone who can get out of bed in the morning is a potential PE fundless sponsor.”\nAlso, managers do not need to invest a lot of time and money into drafting complex offering documents, regulatory compliance and filings as this can wait until a deal is found and indications from investors are positive.\n“Small funds are also exploring with other models such as quasi-hedge funds,” said Swamy. A quasi-hedge fund, much like a hedge fund, has a smaller time horizon than a traditional PE fund and make quick entries and exits.\n“Big funds like ChrysCapital had followed pre-IPO investments, now an entire fund class is emerging which concentrates on such short-term investments,” he said.\nAnother variant of the pledge fund structure is the warehousing model, in which the investor allocates a corpus but does not release the money. Instead, the GP has to source the deal and execute it before more funds can be allocated.\nAccording to Lexygen’s Sambamurthi, the pledge fund structure has evolved because investors are unwilling to commit capital, given the financial environment.\nIn the boom days, people were doing deals faster than the market could produce them, leading to some burning of fingers, he said.\nThe rapid rise of the equity markets has also made it harder for PE investors. The bellwether stock index of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Sensex, has more than doubled since March.\nAlso, GPs sometimes choose to work with greater flexibility; a pledge fund as opposed to a regular fund structure enables this. And if GPs share a close relationship with their LPs, it is plausible that the investors will give them the capital for deals when they need it without being locked into a fund.\nHowever, pledge fund managers do face handicaps. “There is competition for the best deals and a fundless sponsor may not be perceived to be as credible as a buyer or investors with a fund, where the seller knows that the funded sponsor could close the deal immediately while the fundless sponsor needs to raise the money,” Freeman of EM Capital points out. This, he said, may result in the fundless sponsors getting mediocre deals or having to pay higher prices to be able to control the deal long enough to raise funds.\nTo be taken seriously by most sellers, particularly on large, complex deals, it is necessary to show available funding. For the fundless sponsor, the challenge is finding and successfully promoting a deal before they run out of working capital.\nAlso, pledge funds are currently not covered by any law and are off the radar of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India, leaving such funds open to potential abuse.\nTraditional fund houses, however, say these structures will remain on the fringe. “If an LP can do deal sourcing, execution and exit, why should he be an LP, he should rather be a GP,” said Shailesh Vickram Singh, director at 2i Capital India Private Limited. He also pointed out that not all investors are savvy enough to deal with the intricacies of deal-making since the fund manager for a fundless fund must keep going back to the LP.\nFreeman also said that most such deals will largely remain in the small- and mid-market space. Larger deals, requiring larger investors – and by extension, institutional investors – are not suited for pledge funds, he said, because an institutional investor needs a certain level of comfort and level of assurance that comes with an investment management firm.\nThis article first appeared in www.livemint.com on 11 December 2009."}

Once inside the ship's hangar, he put up a fight in order to make his capture look convincing. He was defeated and taken to a prison cell.\nJedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi later infiltrated the ship to release Anakin in order to help apprehend the Count.

{"text": "UW’s sponsorship of Mr. Barrett’s lecture ... lends his views instant credibility by being hosted by a top-flight research university. To be sure, UW in no way endorses Mr. Barrett’s views, but by facilitating the speech, the university did give tacit approval of his theories as a matter of serious academic debate.I don't quite understand this argument. If the subject can be covered in the course, why is it beyond the pale for a lecture? The argument may be that the problem comes when you reveal that you believe in something. But the students in his class know he believes the theory. So perhaps the important line is drawn when the teacher openly says what he believes. But take your example of a geography department hosting a lecture about how the earth is flat. That would, of course, make the geography department look ridiculous. But, in your argument, it would be fine for a geography teacher to take up the students' time with the theory that the earth is flat.\nOne is left to wonder what standards UW applies when determining which lecturers are to be allowed the use of taxpayer-funded facilities to voice their beliefs. Would the geography department allow a speaker to present his opinion that the world is flat? Would the history department sponsor a speech by someone that denies the Holocaust occurred?\nUltimately, it is UW’s duty — as an institution of higher learning funded in part by taxpayers — to promote scholarly research and vigorous academic debate. Mr. Barrett’s conspiracy theories thus far have failed to flirt with either principle.\nIf his conspiracy theories were published in an academic journal, instead of existing solely on a crudely constructed website, perhaps the lecture would be appropriate. Until then, UW should promote discussion rooted in scholarly analysis, not the grassy knoll.\nOctober 2, 2006\nThe Badger Herald -- one of the UW student newspapers -- reconsiders its position on Kevin Barrett (the part-time teacher here who believes that the government perpetrated the 9/11 attacks).

{"text": "Title: Society for General Microbiology M Author\nSubmitted to: Meeting Abstract\nPublication Type: Abstract Only\nPublication Acceptance Date: June 15, 2007\nPublication Date: September 2, 2007\nCitation: Fratamico, P.M. 2007. Society for general microbiology m. Meeting Abstract. P.31. Technical Abstract: The analysis of food and water for the presence of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens is critical for ensuring public health. The traditional approach for bacterial pathogen detection involves enrichment in a suitable growth medium, followed by plating onto selective agar(s) and confirmation of presumptive bacterial isolates using a number of biochemical and serological tests. However, traditional methods are labor intensive and time consuming. The need for a more rapid assessment of the microbial safety of food and water has led to the development of molecular methods, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, for pathogen detection. An important advance is the development of real-time PCR based on the detection and quantitation of a fluorescent reporter in a closed-tube format. Real-time chemistries allow for detection of amplification while the reaction is occurring, thus post-PCR processing for amplicon identification is not required. Applications of PCR assays include detection of specific food-borne pathogens in different types of complex matrices, simultaneous detection of more than one pathogen in a single sample, pathogen typing, and species identification. Real-time multiplex PCR assays, involving amplification of two or more target sequences simultaneously in one reaction, have the potential to decrease cost, time, and effort in pathogen detection. Nanotechnology, as it applies to diagnostics, is a rapidly developing molecular analysis technology that is driving the development of nanofluidic lab-on-a-chip systems. Microminiaturization of nucleic acid-based techniques will have a significant impact on food and water testing, potentially enabling the assays to be performed using portable instruments in non-laboratory settings."}
{"text": "What is the EEOC Litigation Project\nThis project collects and analyzes data on federal court litigation brought from fiscal years 1997 to 2006, inclusive, by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged with enforcing the laws forbidding discrimination by private employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability. The data capture various aspects of the agency's litigation activities, including detailed information regarding the participants, motions, events, and outcomes.\nWhy Study EEOC Litigation\nThe EEOC is an important object of study because of its critical role in enforcing the nation’s anti-discrimination laws, and litigation is one of its crucial enforcement tools. These data provide comprehensive documentation of the EEOC's litigation activity and the relief (both monetary and injunctive) obtained over a ten-year period of time. Equally important, the EEOC's court activity is an ideal subject for studying litigation dynamics and the interaction between litigant and judicial decision-making. Our dataset includes all types of court decisions (published and unpublished, final and non-final, written and summary) and records all kinds of outcomes (default, settlement, pretrial adjudication, judgment after trial), thereby avoiding problems of selection bias that have limited other studies of settlement dynamics and judicial decision-making. By providing detailed information about the EEOC’s enforcement litigation to legal scholars, social scientists and policy-makers, this project will advance understanding of these two important subjects of study – employment discrimination law and practice, and the litigation process more generally.\nHow the Data Were Collected\nWe began with a complete list of all federal court cases brought by the EEOC on behalf of individual complainants from fiscal years 1997 to 2006, inclusive. From this list, we selected a stratified random sample of cases to be included in the study. The sample includes all cases classified by the EEOC as “benefiting” more than one employee, all cases concluded by a court order, and all cases listing a trial date, a total of 1406 cases. In addition, we pulled as large a random sample from the remaining cases as our resources allowed, resulting in a total of 2316 cases.\nUsing the district court docket numbers provided by the EEOC, we searched the federal court system’s web-based docketing system known as PACER (\"Public Access to Court Electronic Records\") for additional data on each case. In particular, we examined the dockets and the available case documents to gather information on the basis for suit, the allegations in the complaint, the presiding judge or judges, the attorneys, the amount of monetary relief and the types of non-monetary relief sought and obtained by the EEOC, with an emphasis on systematically collecting and analyzing the terms of any injunctive relief. We also collected from the PACER dockets detailed data on the litigation events (e.g., motions, discovery disputes, court orders) that occurred in each case prior to resolution as well as coding for the form of resolution in the case (e.g., default, withdrawal, pretrial and trial adjudications). The judges’ biographical information was collected through the use of a variety of online databases and related websites.\nWhere are the Data\nThe collected data are organized into several \"bricks.\" The Master Brick contains an observation for each case in our sample, recording basic information such as the judges assigned to the case, the types of issues and claims it raised, the form of resolution, and whether there was an appeal. The other, secondary bricks provide additional details about the cases and can be linked to the observations in the Master Brick using a unique Case Code assigned to each case in our sample.\nThe EEOC Administrative Data Brick and the accompanying codebook make available the data received from the EEOC on the merits cases it filed during the study period.\nDownload links to these data \"bricks\" can be found in the right-hand column of this page.\nVisit The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse to see the special collection of court documents that were coded in this project."}

{"text": "Pershing 115By Alan Harper\nSome years ago I wrote a piece for a British magazine about a Royal Navy frigate. A state-of-the-art anti-submarine warship, she displaced around 4,800 tons and carried me from the naval base at Portland down the coast to Plymouth, England, at 30 knots, thanks to two Rolls-Royce Olympus gas turbines. Mischievously, as we anchored in the sound in the gathering dusk, I asked the engineering officer to calculate his ship's fuel consumption—not in miles per gallon, but in feet per gallon. With a wry grin he duly did so, and the answer was 273. \"Roughly,\" he added.\nTwo hundred and seventy-three feet per gallon. An insane statistic, obviously, and a mere footnote to the main story, which, after all, concerned a fearsome cold warrior, armed to the teeth with Sea Wolf missiles and nuclear depth charges. But just recently I hitched a ride on the first Pershing 115 as she cruised up the Italian coast at high speed, from La Spezia to the Genoa Boat Show, and I have to confess, I felt a similar desire to translate this turbocharged behemoth's prodigious appetite for diesel into everyday language. Just how far would a gallon of Kuwait's finest take her?\nIt seemed an unworthy thought. It's impolite to bring such subjects up with boats like this. You focus on how beautiful they are, how fast they go, and, if you know the owner well, how much they cost. But nevertheless, with two 3,700-hp V-16 diesels in the engine room and 40 knots on the log, such things do cross your mind.\nAstonishingly, Pershing boss Tilli Antonelli didn't think 7,400 hp would be quite enough for some owners, so each 115 is built with a central molded-in stern pod, ready to accommodate a TF50 gas turbine. The extra 5,600 hp this brings to the party should push the 115's top speed up to around 55 knots (63 mph), with cruising speeds in the high 40s. As for what it will do for the boat's fuel consumption—well, it won't be pretty.\nEven without the TF50, the Pershing 115 is quite a piece of work. Antonelli takes great pride in creating driver's boats, with exciting performance and sweet handling. And although even his sternest critic would probably cut him a little slack now that he's building boats of 100-plus tons, the gargantuan 115 turns out to be as great a ride as all her little sisters. There's that familiar dramatic heel when you crank the helm hard over; a tight turning circle; taut, assertive seakeeping; and a solid, thoroughbred feel. Acceleration is an inevitable victim of the physics of power to weight, but it's still not at all bad—have a look at that curve on the boat spped graph. As for top speed, this boat takes no prisoners.\nWeird as it seems—and believe me, in a boat of this size and displacement, it did seem weird—I found the 115 almost as much fun to handle as the superb 62 I'd tested a couple of weeks before.\nThe 115 is a true Pershing and a great piece of engineering. Getting a boat like this right is impressive enough; getting it right the first time is extraordinary. Yet Antonelli told me that this prototype reached 42 knots the morning after launch (with a clean bottom and clean waterjets) and added, perfectly straight-faced, that they'd found the center of gravity to be four centimeters off. \"But we're happy with that,\" he said, cracking a smile.\nIn fact, he was happy with most things about the 115 when she faced her public for the first time at the autumn shows, and it was easy to see why. The four-cabin layout seems conventional enough on paper, but in the flesh it's refreshingly different. The first two things you notice are how large and unencumbered the saloon is, with no bulkheads to interrupt sightlines and the galley stashed below in the crew's area. The owner of our test boat met the artist Vittoria Vanghelis as she worked on some pieces for Norberto Ferretti, boss of Pershing's parent company, and commissioned her to do some of his own: a sculpted column for each side of the saloon and some colored panels in the deck head, which are subtle but distinctive. The whole area is light and bright, with limed oak joinery, cream carpets and headliners, and white leather upholstery; a pale scheme offset by great views out the windows and a set of colorful dining chairs.\nHead down past the port side of the helm, and a surprise awaits. Instead of a companionway leading down to the lower accommodations, you find a wholly unexpected extra space on its own deck level, which Pershing designers call the mezzanine. On our boat the area was fitted out with leather chairs and sofas, a sound system, and a huge plasma TV, making it a perfect entertainment suite. It could be equally well fitted out as an office, den, crew mess—you name it, Pershing's design team will be happy to comply.\nThe owner's suite is directly below, a huge and well-organized space stretched across the full beam of the hull, between those tall topside windows. It is ingeniously designed around diagonals, with two MSD and shower compartments, a big chest of drawers and sideboard, a walk-in wardrobe, and a sofa, arranged unobtrusively around the edges while your eye is still marveling at the distance between the door and the farthest corner. It's like a magic trick. There is no sense at all that any of these has been allowed to rob an inch from the main cabin.\nThe principal guest suite in the bow also manages to seem huge. While the decorative themes in these areas echo those of the saloon, the two twin guest cabins between them were apparently styled by the owner's daughters, who decreed red leather upholstery and lots of it. It is certainly bold.\nNowhere in the accommodation areas aboard the 115 do you feel that space or volume has been compromised. The cabins are all generously sized and lack neither headroom nor stowage space. The four-berth, three-cabin crew quarters and galley area between the owner's suite and engine room are also well-proportioned, and the engine room itself is vast: deep and wide. Nothing short of a cathedral is ever going to make two MTU Series 4000 V-16s look small, but the engines have plenty of space around them, even with the gensets stacked in the middle. And in the aft section there is that domed pod, ready for the installation of a TF50 gas turbine and third jetdrive should a future owner ever feel the need.\nBefore I closed my notebook, I made one final discovery, up a hidden spiral companionway from the starboard side of the 115's cockpit: a secluded, recessed, rooftop sunpad that provides you with a completely private lounging area—unless, of course, you're moored next to something bigger. If you were to ask for an upper helm station to be installed, I'm sure Antonelli would be more than happy to listen.\nAfter our test routines and handling trials in a calm Gulf of La Spezia and a 45-mile, high-speed cruise through steepening, quartering seas, we headed northwest by west to Genoa. It was while I was up here enjoying the view that I succumbed to the nagging temptation that had surfaced as we set out. As the 115's debonair French skipper eased his precious charge stern-first into the boat show's most awkward berth, I got out my calculator and started punching keys.\nJust how many feet had we been traveling, at something like 40 knots, on each gallon? I checked and rechecked the sum, and then suppressed a guilty shudder: The answer was 692.\nStill, I reflected—that's a lot better than the frigate.\nFerretti Group USA\nThis article originally appeared in the April 2005 issue of Power & Motoryacht magazine."}
{"text": "Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction and sometimes fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Although its literary origins are sometimes associated with the cyberpunk genre, steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century’s British Victorian era or American “Wild West”, in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Steampunk may, therefore, be described as neo-Victorian. Steampunk perhaps most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era’s perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style presentations of such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analogue computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine.\nSteampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre.

{"text": "I have this weird rule for myself. It is one that requires great discipline and mental fortitude. Here it is: I refuse to listen to any Christmas music before Thanksgiving weekend. Okay, this may not seem very ambitious to you, but have you tried doing this in our society? We laud the wonders of the Starbucks gingersnap latte (whatever happened to the gingerbread latte, anyway?) before Election Day has come. And after Halloween, I find it impossible to walk through any department store without being inundated with baubles and festoons of holiday delight. These obstacles make my no pre-yuletide music rule difficult.\nWhy does our culture feel the need to jump into this season immediately after we finish trick-or-treating? Well, quite truthfully, preparing for Christmas is fun! I love getting swept up in the flurry of preparation. The hustle and bustle of shopping, cooking, eating, and longtime family traditions–in their best moments–make us joyful and nostalgic.\nThis period of expectancy is exciting for all who celebrate Christmas but especially for us as Christians. We anticipate the delights of Christmas and most importantly await the birth of our Savior, the mystery of the Word made flesh.\nAs we end the first week of Advent (which began last Sunday), we have begun four weeks of fasting and waiting to prepare for the celebration feast of Jesus' arrival. We join the church across the globe in eager expectation because this season unifies all who submit themselves to waiting for Jesus. It is a time to ponder what the incarnation really means for us: A God so majestic and beyond our scope of understanding humbled himself in the form of a helpless, utterly dependent infant. He came in humanity so we could know his divinity–that we could see him as Savior and Emmanuel–God with us.\nThrough Advent we also understand–on a very small scale–what the Israelites of Christ's day were feeling. How long had they waited for their Messiah? How long had his coming been foretold and prophesied? They were sick of waiting as they experienced exile and persecution. But still they waited. Why? Because they needed this Savior and they trusted their God would fulfill his promise. Look at this example from the prophet Isaiah:\n\"Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law.\" (Isaiah 42:1-4)"}
{"text": "The Primary Mission of the Vedic Temple\nby Stephen Knapp\nIt is not often recognized, but the primary mission of the temple, over and above everything else, is to inspire others to take a serious look into the real purpose and practice of the Vedic spiritual path and to participate in the tradition. Many think the main purpose of the temple is to provide a place where people can simply go to do their prayers, pujas and observe the holy days. Of course, that is part of it or it would not be a Vedic temple, but without invoking the inspiration to do that, especially in the youth, then in another 2 or 3 generations many of our sparkling new temples will turn into mere warehouses, or at best museum pieces.\nIf temples can provide and invoke the proper inspiration in its members and visitors, this will help secure the continuation of the temple, the Vedic community, and the culture itself long into the future. Some of the most difficult assets the temple has to attain are funds and manpower, or the help to continue its programs. If it can invoke the inspiration, then the funds and voluntary service will follow so that it can continue with its programs, whether they be pujas, holy day festivals, educating the youth, and so on. Therefore, it is imperative that temples and the managers and priests must arrange things in a way so that everyone becomes increasingly inspired to participate in temple activities and the Vedic tradition itself. People should be inspired and, thus, motivated to:\n1. Recognize the benefits of the Vedic traditions;\n2. Understand the tradition and its purpose more deeply;\n3. Realize why they should participate in the culture and its spiritual practice;\n4. Through service or seva, get a deeper taste and spiritual happiness, and a sense of fulfillment from the Dharmic path that cannot be attained through the temporary glitter of material pursuits or the mental preoccupation of sensual desires;\n5. To acquire what is the secret knowledge about life and its purpose, knowing that it cannot easily be found anywhere else;\n6. Understand our eternal spiritual identity and connection with the Divine;\n7. Help in the operation of the temple for oneself and others, knowing the temple is like the launching pad to the higher purpose of life, and the spiritual dimensions of existence, and certainly to the more refined states of consciousness and fulfillment that everyone seeks, and which the Vedic literature describes.\nIn this way, the temple and the way it conducts itself should help in the transition of people from being mere observers, to appreciators, to participants, up to taking responsibilities to help the temple in service to the deities and other temple members, or the general community. If the temple can do this, then it and everyone associated with it will secure a bright future, not only for the temple, but for the whole Vedic community, for the Dharmic tradition, and for humanity as a whole.\nSo first, let us look at these basic points of inspiration the temple must provide, and see how a person can progress from one point to the next:\n1. To recognize the benefits of the Vedic tradition.\nWhen you visit a temple, the benefits are not always apparent. Naturally, you may see the beautiful grounds around a lovely temple building. Or you may get darshan of the gorgeously decorated deities, which should be inspiring in and of itself. You may also see the intricate rituals and hear the prayers or chanting and realize you should attend the temple more often. But without understanding the benefits, it may only take a cricket match or ball game on television to distract you away from attending the temple. So it should go deeper than that. People need to be able to comprehend the activities and rituals, at least on a basic level, and then perceive the benefits and blessings we get from such activities, and why it is good to participate. This leads to the next point, which is:\n2. To understand the tradition more deeply. We have seen that if the priests or pujaris explain the rituals while they are performing them, or if there is a class in the temple on the meaning of the rituals and the philosophy, or if books are available, or if there are temple study groups to join, we can begin to see and understand the deeper purpose of what goes on at the temple, and why we should be a part of it. Another thing that has always been helpful is if there are prayer books that contain the words of the mantras or bhajans that are used in the temple. But these should be in the original Sanskrit or Hindi with Roman transliteration, and with English interpretations. Then people can follow along or understand it with more appreciation, especially the youth who may not know the traditional languages.\nIn this way, as people begin to perceive the benefits and purpose of the temple and the meaning of the activities that go on there, people will be encouraged to increase their appreciation for what the temple has to offer, and to support it.\n3. The next step is to participate. It is one thing to be an observer with appreciation, but it is another thing to be a participant. When a person decides to participate, no longer is he or she merely watching what others are doing, but he begins to be a part of the pujas, and prayer or chanting sessions, bhajans, or he even begins to help organize festivals on holy days, or with cleaning the temple, and so on. This opens the door for one to receive the higher taste of seva or service, not only to the temple, but for the deity in the temple. This is how a person begins to get to the next point.\n4. Getting the higher taste of spiritual happiness and fulfillment by being engaged in spiritual activities. This is the reciprocation between oneself and the Divine. This is when temple management should be able to guide a person in the proper services that guests and progressing devotees can do. This is when one enters the stage of being convinced by direct experience and perception, however simple it may be at first. Combined with Vedic spiritual knowledge, along with sadhana or practice, and with the performance of seva, no other process can deliver one to deeper and deeper levels of that higher taste more effectively than this.\nWhen a person begins to feel this reciprocation, or also begins to understand the importance of this culture, then they naturally want to give back. They feel that they want to provide support for this great path of Vedic Dharma and spirituality, and for the connection with God that they feel. Then they want to do service, they want to contribute to the cause and the temple. I have seen this with people so many times.\n5. The temple can also inspire people to recognize it as the preserver and protector of sacred spiritual knowledge, and the center for educating people in it for those who can humbly approach it. The temple can be viewed as the center for the secret knowledge that can hardly be found anywhere else, and which can give a person the means for point number 6.\n6. Understanding your true, eternal spiritual identity and connection with the spiritual strata. This only has to be reawakened by being guided in the Vedic formula and process, a part of which is observing the activities in the temple which helps make things easier. Why is this secret knowledge? As it is described by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita: \"This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.\" (Bg. 9.2)\nThis means that it is a natural process of purifying or spiritualizing our consciousness so that we can actually perceive that which is spiritual. It is not a mere dogma that must be followed without understanding or without question. But that we advance according to our own development until we eventually reach direct perception of the self. There are few processes that can do that. Nonetheless, just by following the path we can attain the supreme spiritual peace, which is something that is not easy to find. As Lord Krishna also explains in the Bhagavad-gita: \"In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has achieved this enjoys the self within himself in due course of time. A faithful man who is absorbed in transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace.\" (Bg. 4.38-39)\nNow tell me, where else can you find this kind of advice? This is the significance of this sort of information from the Vedic culture, which everyone should understand. This brings us to point number seven.\n7. When a person fully understands all that we have described so far, and especially when one begins to experience the higher taste of such spiritual practice, then he or she will also help in the operation of the temple in some way. This will not only be for his own continued progress and spiritual development, but he will be inspired from within to work for the development of all others in order to give them the same opportunity to experience this deep Vedic culture. There is also no faster way to develop spiritual merit than to assist or help make arrangements for the spiritual progress of others.\nADDITIONAL WAYS TO DO THIS\nThis list should also pave the way to brainstorm to develop new ideas for expanding this purpose of the temples. For example:\n1. There can also be Festivals of Inspiration, or festivals to celebrate the Dharmic tradition. Holding such festivals, either combined with other holy days or not, can bring people together to celebrate the Vedic path, and to become more inspired by what it has to offer. Such festivals at the temple can have special events and guest speakers to present such topics as:\nA. The history and significance of the tradition;\nB. How to overcome certain problems while on the Dharmic path;\nC. How to raise or have a spiritual family;\nD. How to increase one’s progress on the Vedic spiritual path;\nE. How to be practical and realize deeper levels of spirituality.\n2. Home study groups, where people get together for basic classes and discussions to help everyone become more familiar with the philosophy, get acquainted with others on the path, enjoy that uplifting association, and also serve prasada, sacred food, and savor a comfortable environment with others that are like-minded.\n3. Special classes that outline instructions for home activities in the practice of Vedic spirituality, such as how to establish a prayer and meditation or temple room in the house, or how to engage in a process for one’s own spiritual practice or sadhana at home, etc.\n4. How to engage in outreach programs to reach the local community, or how to share your own experience of Vedic culture with other people you meet so they can appreciate it and become more curious about it, or even invite them to visit the temple to see it for themselves.\n5. Develop more ways to involve the youth.\nThese and other programs can be utilized to increase everyone’s enjoyment and involvement in the culture, and use the temple as the center of the tradition.\nBASIC SERVICES THAT GUESTS\nCAN OFFER FOR THE TEMPLE\nThese are ideas and services that guests can perform in their service to the temple, but, of course, should be offered under the guidance of temple management who can show people first what and how things should be done. No one should come to the temple and then decide for themselves whatever they want to do, which can be contrary to the overall plan, or in some cases can even be destructive to what is trying to be accomplished.\n1. Remove weeds from the flower or vegetable garden.\n2. Help with planting flowers,\n3. Water flower beds,\n4. Assist with Vegetable garden,\n5. Lawn Mowing, or raking or blowing leaves,\n6. Edging sidewalks,\n7. General gardening, mulch & landscaping work,\n8. Cleaning the\n9. General pot washing or kitchen clean up,\n10. Helping clean hallways, carpets, stairways, etc. in the temple,\n11. Assist with Sunday feast clean up or pot washing,\n12. Help with picking\nflowers for deity garlands,\n13. Help with flower delivery set up & clean up,\n14. Clean up temple: floor, altar gates, Vyasasan, charanamrita set up & hand cleaning area, drain and clean water pots, clean mirrors and windows, dust walls, etc.\n15. Clean up bath rooms,\n16. Organize shoe area and glass doorways,\n17. Assisting with festival preparation & organization or clean up, or car parking,\nFOR THOSE SPECIALLY QUALIFIED\n18. Help with Sunday feast vegetable cut up,\n19. Deity kitchen floor & stoves,\n20. Help with deity garland making,\n21. Deity laundry,\n22. Deity dress repair,\n23. Assisting with caring for Tulasi plants,\n24. Making a daily\nsweet for the deities,\n25. Brick & cement & stucco repair work,\n26. Painting: outdoor & indoor,\nMore ideas can be suggested according to the needs of the temple. But these duties should be planned and ready for those who want to offer service for the temple. Anyone who is willing to do service should not be turned away as if they are not needed. Everyone, if they are qualified and can accept direction, should feel they have something to contribute, and be shown how. This is the beginning in a person’s spiritual growth, which can be very important, and how they continue to contribute to the well-being of the temple, which in turn contributes to their own spiritual well-being.\n[This article in from www.stephen-knapp.com]"}

{"text": "Many people worldwide know that Bentonville is home to the largest retailer on the planet, but there are some new amenities and historical facts that may be unknown to visitors and residents alike.\nThere were approximately 4,000 residents of Bentonville when I joined that number in the early 1960s. That number is now well over 35,000, which represents an almost 800 percent increase in population since I was born.\nThe influx of people can certainly be attributed to jobs at the headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and to vendors that serve Wal-Mart. The Bentonville Convention & Visitors Bureau also deserves credit for drawing people to the town, now city, and Downtown Bentonville, Inc. (DBI) does an excellent job of making sure folks have plenty to do once they arrive.\nDowntown Square during event hosted by Downtown Bentonville, Inc. Bentonville, Ark.\nWorking with partner organizations, DBI focuses on the downtown area, known as The Square, and hosts Farmers Markets, First Friday events, and other community activities. Both organizations highlight Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which will open 11-11-11, the Walmart Visitors Center, Museum of Native American History, and the newest additions to the area – the splash park, which is converted into a skating rink in the winter, and Orchards Park.\nMost newcomers and visitors to Bentonville either are aware of, or quickly become aware of, the amenities mentioned and pictured above. However, there are some lesser known attractions that deserve attention as well.\nWhen I was in elementary school, I recall that one of my favorite things to do was to gather a bunch of neighborhood friends and walk to Park Springs, which was located only a few blocks from our homes. We didn’t go there for picnics; rather, we went to explore the spring found down a deep, wooded slope from the pavilion area.\nUnlike today, where bridges have been added and the brush has been cleared away, the area immediately around the spring used to be one where adventurous kids would walk across nature-made bridges of fallen trees, weave through tangled branches, and enjoy the cool water of this natural splash park.\nMore rustic parts of Park Springs. Bentonville, Ark.\nWhen inquiring on Facebook if any of my friends had pictures of the “old” Bentonville Pool, I found out something I never knew about Park Springs. Bentonville native Charles Pratt asked if I was referring to the pool off of 8th Street “or the one that was at Park Springs where I first went to swim when I was a youngster?”\nPratt told me about a pool in Bentonville that was around long before I was. Pratt said, “The pool at Park Springs was a rectangular concrete pool with concrete apron and it had a deep end for swimming and diving and a shallow end for young children and non-swimmers. It was roughly in the middle of the park and had a rough wooden structure off the west side for changing rooms. The deep end was to the north, on the downhill slope naturally.” Even natives can learn a thing or two about Bentonville’s history!\nThe downtown square was the epicenter of the community when I was growing up. So, it was unusual, and always a treat, when my mom would tell me that she was taking me out to eat and we would head in a direction other than toward downtown. As we would make our way south on old Highway 71, and go around Rainbow Curve, so called because at the time it used to be a more natural hill and the road had an arc to it, I was thrilled because I immediately knew that our destination was Glasgow’s Restaurant. This restaurant that used to be “out in the country” is now surrounded by multi-story hotels and is dwarfed by them. Yet, it is still open for business.\nThe cover of the menu reads: Glasgow’s Mexican & American Foods. Family Owned and Operated Since 1964. On a recent visit, I was very pleased to find that Glasgow’s has changed little in 47 years. I sat in the same booth my mom and I used to sit in, and caught myself looking over to find the one thing, in addition to the tacos, that drew me to Glasgow’s when I was a child – was the Marlin still mounted on the wall? It’s still there!\nMarlin caught by J.D. Glasgow displayed on wall at Glasgow's Restaurant. Bentonville, Ark.\nThe waitress I spoke with, Cheyenne, told me that her grandparents, J.D. and Connie Glasgow, were the ones to open the restaurant almost 50 years ago. And, yes, it was J.D. who caught the Marlin many years ago when he was on a fishing trip in Mazatlan, Mexico.\nAs in most cities and towns, there is always a funny sign to be found. In the 1970s, a subdivision was built in Bentonville called Bland Valley. What appeared in that subdivision was the corner of “Crouch” and “P.” Needless to say, those of us who were teenagers in those days thought this was quite amusing. Frankly, I still think it’s funny!\nWhile some of my favorite spots in Bentonville are no longer around, the “old” Bentonville Pool, Virgie’s Drive-In, and Dari-O come to mind, many remain and many new attractions are being added. As the Bentonville Convention & Visitors Bureau’s motto goes: “Strong Heritage, Bright Future.” That is so true for Bentonville, Arkansas."}

If you specify 16, you'd get 0.4V ABOVE the normal value of 1.2V, or 1.6V. The fact that someone carefully specified \"8\" and \"1.4V\" as the upper limit in the examples leads me to think that it is likely to shorten the life of your raspberry pi significantly if you would specify values above \"8\".

{"text": "Key Components of Drug Court\nThe early drug courts were planned to meet the specific needs of local law enforcement, courts and communities. However, many other jurisdictions used those as models and established similar goals in starting their own courts. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals’ (NADCP) Standards Committee developed a manual on drug courts which sets forth ten key elements of successful drug courts:\n- Integrate alcohol and other drug treatment services with justice system case processing. A team approach must be taken to stop drug abuse and related criminal activity. Courts can motivate offenders to enter treatment, but must work with treatment providers to ensure participants’ success. For instance, treatment providers report offenders’ treatment progress to courts in order to ensure collaborative use of sanctions and rewards.\n- Use a non-adversarial approach in which prosecution and defense counsel promote public safety while protecting participants’ due process rights. Prosecution and defense attorneys must work together as a team and focus on offenders’ recovery rather than the merits of the case. Prosecutors are responsible for identifying drug court candidates, and defense attorneys are obligated to protect offenders’ rights and inform them about the drug court process.\n- Identify eligible participants early for immediate referral to the program. Substance abuse problems may be easier to identify after offenders are arrested. When experiencing the crisis of arrest, offenders may be more open to pursuing treatment because the consequences of drug use are so obvious at that time.\n- Provide access to a continuum of treatment and rehabilitation services. Only part of offenders’ treatment takes place in the courtroom or in formal treatment settings. Creating a therapeutic team ensures that secondary issues, such as health care, housing and unemployment are addressed. If these problems are ignored, successful substance abuse treatment will be compromised. Offenders need access to a full range of services as one size does not fit all.\n- Monitor abstinence by frequent drug testing. Drug testing is the most reliable, objective way to detect recent drug use. A drug testing system ensures individual accountability and helps gouge participant’s progress and compliance.\n- Coordinate court and treatment program responses to participants’ compliance or lack of compliance, including contingency contracts that involve participants in their own sanctions and incentives. Rewards and sanctions should promote ending drug use. Graduated sanctions are used in response to non-compliance with treatment. Rewards are given for negative drug tests and attending all drug court meetings and treatment sessions.\n- Require ongoing judicial interaction with drug court participants. Judges lead the drug court team and link participants with treatment providers. Judicial supervision shows participants that someone in authority cares and increases the chances that participants will remain in th program.\n- Monitor and evaluate achievement of program goals and program effectiveness. The goals and objectives of drug court programs should be measurable. Objective outcome data provide accountability to funding agencies and policy makers; positive outcomes increase the likelihood of continued funding and community support for programs.\n- Promote effective drug court planning through interdisciplinary education of planning teams. Key drug court personnel, as well as those indirectly involved in the program, should continue to receive training and education. Continued education ensures that the drug court’s goals and policies are understood and provides opportunities for ongoing interaction between personnel from different agencies.\n- Forge partnerships among drug courts, public agencies and community-based organizations. Drug courts create partnerships among organizations dedicated to rehabilitating substance abusing offenders. Multiple partnerships increase services available to participants during and after the program.\nThe Sixteen Juvenile Strategies\n- Collaborative Planning - Engage all stakeholders in creating an interdisciplinary, coordinated, and systemic approach to working with youth and their families.\n- Teamwork - Develop and maintain an interdisciplinary, nonadversarial work team.\n- Clearly Defined Target Population and Eligibility Criteria - Define a target population and eligibility criteria that are aligned with the program’s goals and objectives.\n- Judicial Involvement and Supervision - Schedule frequent judicial reviews and be sensitive to the effect that court proceedings can have on youth and their families.\n- Monitoring and Evaluation - Establish a system for program monitoring and evaluation to maintain quality of service, assess program impact, and contribute to knowledge in the field.\n- Community Partnerships - Build partnerships with community organizations to expand the range of opportunities available to youth and their families.\n- Comprehensive Treatment Planning -Tailor interventions to the complex and varied needs of youth and their families.\n- Developmentally Appropriate Services -Tailor treatment to the developmental needs of adolescents.\n- Gender-Appropriate Services - Design treatment to address the unique needs of each gender.\n- Cultural Competence - Create policies and procedures that are responsive to cultural differences and train personnel to be culturally competent.\n- Focus on Strengths - Maintain a focus on the strengths of youth and their families during program planning and in every interaction between the court and those it serves.\n- Family Engagement - Recognize and engage the family as a valued partner in all components of the program.\n- Educational Linkages - Coordinate with the school system to ensure that each participant enrolls in and attends an educational program that is appropriate to his or her needs.\n- Drug Testing - Design drug testing to be frequent, random, and observed. Document testing policies and procedures in writing.\n- Goal-Oriented Incentives and Sanctions - Respond to compliance and noncompliance with incentives and sanctions that are designed to reinforce or modify the behavior of youth and their families.\n- Confidentiality - Establish a confidentiality policy and procedures that guard the privacy of the youth while allowing the drug court team to access key information."}

{"text": "Joe was an young boy. He was the favorite son for his father. His father always got him the best dress available in the market. Life was straight and smooth for him. Straight and smooth until he had a dream. His dream was that he would someday become a great ruler or a king. He was very excited. He started telling his brothers about his dream in his life. No one encouraged him. Not even one. Instead they started to hate him. As he sat in the dining table, someone whispered, here is the great dreamer. Everyone got a good laugh at his cost. Sharing his great dreams in life helped him turn his brothers into his enemies.\nOne day as he was taking food for his brothers, who were tending the sheep at a distance place, Joe didn’t know that his straight life was going into troubled end. His brothers, put him in a pit. There was a turn in his life. Sometimes in order to reach the destination, life takes its own twist and turns. His only way of seeing the light, was seeing upwards. He thought he was going to die in the pit. So he sat at the corner of the pit. But suddenly he was reminded of his dream. He thought to himself that this is not the way life will end for me. Though he found nothing in common with where he wanted to be and where he was now, he said to himself, this is not the end. His dream started to give him hope. Sometimes in life, when we feel like we are in a pit, and life seems to have come like a hurricane upon us, the only thing that sustains us is a promise or a dream that we have. No matter even if no one encourages us, our dream starts to carry us. We need to have dreams and vision in our life.\nSuddenly Joe found a rope coming down the pit. The very brothers who put him in a pit, as they saw a group of travelers, thought, let us make use of him and have some money. Here comes another turn in his life. From pit to become a slave.Now, wait a minute! did he not dream of becoming a king? Yes of course. But look where he was now. It seemed that he was heading exactly in the opposite direction. Thats how life is sometimes. But Joe, knew God was in control. Though it seemed, they used him and got money, God used them and brought Joe, a step closer to his dream. He uses your enemies to help you achieve your goal in life.\nSo now Joe was in Egypt. There came the next turn in his life. He was sold toan officer in Egypt. He was a bit comfortable there. Though he missed his home and his family, he was sincere in his work. He started to gain confidence and everything at last seemed to fall in place. His master saw his sincere work and promoted him to position next to him. Joe was happy. He thought he was “settled”.\nBut his master’s wife thought otherwise. She was nagging Joe to cross the limit. But Joe’s answer was “How can I do this against God”. Against Whom? Not his master, not his tradition. His baseline for not sinning was God. Unfortunately he was not appreciated for his integrity. Instead he was sent to prison with false accusation. So here came the next turn of his life. When he thought his life came together, all hell broke loose. Remember his dream was to become a king. But now he was in the prison. May be God Thought the best way to enter the palace is through the prison. God has his own way of doing things.\nNow I visualize Joe as the most depressed person on earth. He had great dreams but now he must have thought he was nowhere near it. Actually he was so close than ever. From pit to Portipar’s home to prison. But Joe was not downcast. He started being sincere in prison. Sincere in prison?? Sincere as a King seems to suit Joe’s Dream. But Sincere in prison.Isn’t it Bizarre?? No matter where he was, Joe was Sincere. You never heard him grumble or complaint in the pit or as a slave or now in prison. He could have said, when I get to the throne I’ll work hard. No. He was sincere in a prison. There in prison he was promoted. When you are sincere and when the Lord is with you, even if you are in prison you will be promoted.\nOne of his friend whom he had helped by interpreting his dream, was released. So Joe, told him to make arrangements to get him out by speaking to the King. But his friend forgot him. An unthankful friend didnot make Joe be unthankful to God. He waited. He worked hard. Until the KING got a dream. He was confused. (Throughout this story I see dreams bringing confusion :)) Joe interprets for the king. The king is stunned and he makes him ruler over Egypt. At last his dream is fulfilled. His final turn in life brought him to his destination. Pit, Slave, Prison and Palace was his path. Through twist and turns in his life Joseph at last came to the reality of his dream. It is easier to go straight in life, but twist and turns mayhelpto reach destination.\nDo we have great dreams for our life? Desires that seem impossible. Does your situation seem tough and trying? Don’t be discouraged? The ONE who gives great Dreams and Desires will Direct you to your Destination in life by His Divine Grace."}
{"text": "Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute and a group of colleagues conducted a study which has led him to conclude that IRS scrutiny of Tea Party groups prior to the 2012 election reduced turnout and led to Barack Obama’s victory.\nIn a new research paper, Andreas Madestam (from Stockholm University), Daniel Shoag and David Yanagizawa-Drott (both from the Harvard Kennedy School), and I set out to find out how much impact the Tea Party had on voter turnout in the 2010 election. We compared areas with high levels of Tea Party activity to otherwise similar areas with low levels of Tea Party activity, using data from the Census Bureau, the FEC, news reports, and a variety of other sources. We found that the effect was huge: the movement brought the Republican Party some 3 million-6 million additional votes in House races.That is an astonishing boost, given that all Republican House candidates combined received fewer than 45 million votes.\nVeuger goes on to make a key assumption that I could not find in the study. (The study is about the impact of citizen protests on increased voter turnout, using the Tea Party as its key example. It gives a great deal of attention to the effect of rainfall on the success of protest events, with accompanying mathematical formulas). So I assume this is Vueger speaking for himself and not for his colleagues:\nThe data show that had the Tea Party groups continued to grow at the pace seen in 2009 and 2010, and had their effect on the 2012 vote been similar to that seen in 2010, they would have brought the Republican Party as many as 5 – 8.5 million votes compared to Obama’s victory margin of 5 million.\nBut the IRS’s focus on Tea Party non-profits, he says, interrupted that pace of growth. He provides no evidence for that assumption before jumping to another one: the IRS’s interest in Tea Party non-profits must have been at the direction of Obama’s operatives or “it may just be that a bureaucracy dominated by liberals picked up on not-so-subtle dog whistles from its political leadership.”\nAs a consequence, the founders, members, and donors of new Tea Party groups found themselves incapable of exercising their constitutional rights, and the Tea Party’s impact was muted in the 2012 election cycle.\nThere are two problems with this conclusion. The first problem is that the popular vote for GOP House candidates in 2012 was 58 million compared to 2010′s 45 million. Instead of being incapable of exercising their constitutional rights, 13 million more Tea Party-influenced voters apparently were very capable of exercising their rights. Of course, 2012 was a presidential election year which always produces a higher vote. But a 28 percent surge in voting can hardly be described as a “muted” impact.\nMoreover, the GOP’s share of the 2012 House vote was six million more than in the previous presidential cycle in 2008. Vueger claims the Tea Party should have produced 5-8 million more votes in 2012, and it looks like that’s exactly what it did, substantially increasing the GOP’s totals over 2008 and 2010. So what’s this business about the IRS?\nThere’s a second problem. The IRS was focused on 501(c)3 non-profits. Veuger quotes one activist, as recounted in the Wall St. Journal:\nAs Toby Marie Walker, who runs the Waco Tea Party, which filed for tax-exempt status in 2010 but didn’t receive approval until two months ago, recounted recently: “Our donors dried up. It was intimidating and time-consuming.”\nThe American Ideas Institute, which publishes TAC, is a non-profit. So is the American Enterprise Institute, where Veuger is employed. So Veuger and I know something about tax-exempt non-profits.\nWe both know they are not allowed to to engage in political campaigns. He and I can sympathize with any organization whose “donors dried up.” However, if those donations were expected — in any way — to be used for partisan purposes, the IRS was right to examine them. Non-profits can use tax-exempt money to increase voter turnout as a civic effort. But they are not allowed even to endorse candidates, much less campaign for them. It seems like an oversight on Veuger’s part not to acknowledge that some Tea Party groups in their exuberance were trampling over the clearly painted line that he and I both know so well, thereby assuring the interest of law enforcement agencies such as the IRS.\nPeggy Noonan on Friday touted Vueger’s spin on the study (which she clearly did not read) and seemed especially taken with the theory that it was a Democratic voter suppression effort:\nThink about the sheer political facts of the president’s 2012 victory. The first thing we learned, in the weeks after the voting, was that the Obama campaign was operating with a huge edge in its technological operation—its vast digital capability and sophistication. The second thing we learned, in the past month, is that while the campaign was on, the president’s fiercest foes, in the Tea Party, were being thwarted, diverted and stopped. Technological savvy plus IRS corruption. The president’s victory now looks colder, more sordid, than it did.\nThinking about it, as Noonan suggests I do, I just cannot find a there there. The Tea Party seems to have contributed to a higher vote for the GOP — measured by the popular vote for the House, which is Veuger’s baseline — in 2012 than in 2008, and much a larger total than 2010. Meanwhile, the Tea Party was not being “thwarted, diverted, and stopped.” The IRS was examining the applications of Tea Party-affiliated non-profits, none of which should have had anything to do with the campaign anyway.\nThere was a good reason they were being examined. Although we would like to think these citizens groups are as pure as newly fallen snow, the fact is, some Tea Party non-profits were clearly breaking the law.\nNot for the first time in the last few years, Peggy Noonan needs to take a deep breath. And AEI might want to caution Stan Veuger about using his colleagues’ straightforward scholarly work to extrapolate a case that is not there.\nWick Allison is president of the American Ideas Institute."}

Thus this simple\nscale allows you to draw out the proper blade angles at various\npoints of the blade with no figuring whatsoever.\nDirections and a simple explanation for using this system will\nbe given first. Further explanations and pointers for the more persistent\nCut the \"Pi-Bar\" scale out and glue it to a piece of 1/16\" plywood\nor its equal and when dry trim to the scale edge. Be careful to\nuse only a thin film of glue so as not to stretch the paper scale\nfrom excess wetting.\nStep 1: Get a sheet of paper and mark off inch measurements along\nthe bottom edge, starting from the right-hand side, and number these\n1, 2. 3. etc. These points correspond to the inch radius points\non your propeller with the starting point as the center line of\nStep 2: Now place the ''Pi-Bar'' scale on the right side of the\nsheet with the \"0\" point on the scale at the hub starting: point.\nFind the number on the scale that corresponds to the pitch you wish\nto use and mark the edge of the paper at that point. With a rule,\ndraw connecting lines from your inch radius points to this pitch\npoint. This gives you the correct angles that your propeller blades\nmust be given at the various radius points to have the pitch you\nFrom this point in the process you can proceed in several different\nways, varying in the amount of effort required and also in the quality\nof the results obtained.\nStep 3: The simplest method is to draw out the front view of\nthe propeller blank in the actual size and shape you wish the finished\npropeller to have, and mark it off in inch radius marks, numbering\nthem from the hub out to correspond with your scale on the bottom\nof the sheet.\nStep 4: Measure the width of the blank at each radius point and\nstarting at that same radius point on the bottom of your sheet,\nmark off this measurement to the right side of this point (on 3\"\nradius, A-B). Now with a square or 90 deg. angle draw a vertical\nline from this measurement point to intersect with the pitch angle\nabove B-C). The length of this vertical line B-C is the proper depth\nfor your propeller blank at that radius point. The length of the\npitch line (A-C) will be the width of your propeller blade at that\npoint. Finish this operation for all the radius points.\nStep 5: The next step is to draw out a side view of the propeller\nblank, making the outline fit the measurements at their proper radius\npoints (on 3\" radius, B-C).\nWith the front and side patterns now completed, it is a simple\nmatter to transfer them to a block of balsa and cut out accordingly.\nBe very careful in cutting the blank to cut accurately to the\noutline, and in carving, to carve to the very corner of the blank,\nand you will get a perfectly pitched propeller with a finished blade\nKeep this pitch layout, as you can use it for other propellers\nof different shapes and diameters of that same pitch. If this layout\nis made on graph paper scaled to the inch in 1/16 or 1/20 inch divisions,\nit will be much easier to do your work accurately.\nNow for a little more comprehensive data on the subject. The\nsame relationship exists between the depth and the width of a propeller\nblock at any point as exists between the pitch and \"pi\" (3.1416)\nx diameter at same point.\nTherefore, knowing the propeller diameter and the pitch we may\ndesire, all we have to do is to layout the pitch/π diameter relationships\nin geometrical form and from them take off the correct depth/width\nrelationships of the block for any width of blade desired. Transferring\nthese depth and width measurements to the proper place on outline\ndrawings and connecting the points with a curve will give you an\naccurately pitched propeller layout.\nSince we want to key out angles for only one blade, we will use\nthe radius measurements, so the formula actually becomes\nis the part of. the formula we are using. The inch measurement\nfor diameters is practically standard, so we have allocated this\nscale relationship to the pitch factor.

This measurement is transcribed on the\nThe preferred method of procedure for layouts is to draw out your\nactual finished blade shape with the proper amount of area, draw\nthe radius lines on this planform, and transfer the width measurements\non the pitch lines. It is a good practice to put a half-inch radius\nline next to the tip to get more accuracy at this vital point. Vertical\nlines dropped to the bottom of the sheet will give you both the\nwidth and depth of the blank at those points to obtain the desired\npitch and finished blade width.

{"text": "Friday, February 19, 2010\nIt's the \"stimulus bill,\" dummy\nOn Wednesday, the one-year anniversary of the signing of the stimulus bill, Obama held a press event in the Executive Office Building to praise the success of the legislation. Portions of it were widely reported in the MSM, especially this section—\nI want to begin by recalling where we were one year ago. Millions of jobs had already been lost to the recession before I was sworn into office. Another 800,000 would be lost in the month of January. We'd later learn that our economy had shrunk by an astounding 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009. And economists from across the political spectrum warned that if dramatic action was not taken to break the back of the recession, the United States could spiral into another depression.\nOne year later, it is largely thanks to the Recovery Act that a second depression is no longer a possibility. It's one of the main reasons the economy has gone from shrinking by 6 percent to growing at about 6 percent. And this morning we learned that manufacturing production posted a strong gain. So far, the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about 2 million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. These aren't just our numbers; these are the estimates of independent, nonpartisan economists across the spectrum.\nNow, despite all this, the bill still generates some controversy. And part of that is because there are those, let's face it, across the aisle who have tried to score political points by attacking what we did, even as many of them show up at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for projects in their districts. (Laughter and applause.) But if we're honest, part of the controversy also is, is that despite the extraordinary work that has been done through the Recovery Act, millions of Americans are still without jobs. Millions more are struggling to make ends meet. So it doesn't yet feel like much of a recovery. And I understand that. It's why we're going to continue to do everything in our power to turn this economy around.\nObama was introduced by Vice President Biden, who of course also praised the bill. Would you believe that neither used the word \"stimulus\" or the phrase \"stimulus bill\"? Not once! Instead they talked about the \"Recovery Act.\"\nAt least one speechwriter needs to be fired. Haven't they heard that Americans are confusing the stimulus bill with the financial bailouts, and that the mere thought of the bailouts gets them hopping-mad (even to the point of flying a plane into government offices1)? And don't they know that a sentence such as \"economists from across the political spectrum warned that if dramatic action was not taken to break the back of the recession, the United States could spiral into another depression\" can easily be taken to refer to the bailouts?\nJeesh! Republican PR guys will do anything for money. Can't the Obama administration hire one of them?\nA note on Obama (2/15/10)\nWhy is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours?\nI remember reading about the stock market crash before the “great” depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isn’t it ironic how far we’ve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesn’t have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and it’s “business-as-usual”. Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes… isn’t that a clever, tidy solution.\nThursday, February 18, 2010\nA domestic suicide attack\nI was thinking about posting a note on the Tea Party movement when I caught the news of Joseph Stack's suicidal airplane crash into an Austin building that houses offices of the IRS.\nAn hour before the crash Stack updated his website a final time by posting what is being characterized in the media as a \"manifesto.\" I would have called it a rant, which is how Stack himself described it. His website has been taken down at the request of the FBI, to what purpose I do not know since The Smoking Gun has published the text online.\nI was not the first to think of the Tea Party movement as I read of Joseph Stack. Washington Post reporter Jonathan Capehart wrote on his blog—\n... after reading his 34-paragraph screed, I am struck by how his alienation is similar to that we're hearing from the extreme elements of the Tea Party movement.\nCapehart did not write that Stack considered himself a part of the movement, only that he was struck by the similarities between Stack's \"alienation\" and the messages coming from some of the Tea Baggers. This was sufficient, however, to trigger reactions such as—\nVery trashy reporting. A cursory read of the note indicates no such affiliations. Perhaps you would like to arrest those who harbor dislike against the government? That's the logical extension of your thinking.\nI have no idea whether Stack considered himself to be a Tea Bagger, but what is clear is that he might easily be found at a Tea Party event, as described by David Barstow—\nLocal Tea Party groups are often loosely affiliated with one of several competing national Tea Party organizations. In the background, offering advice and organizational muscle, are an array of conservative lobbying groups, most notably FreedomWorks. Further complicating matters, Tea Party events have become a magnet for other groups and causes — including gun rights activists, anti-tax crusaders, libertarians, militia organizers, the “birthers” who doubt President Obama’s citizenship, Lyndon LaRouche supporters and proponents of the sovereign states movement.\nStack in fact concluded his writing with this—\nThe Communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\nThe capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.\nThis—along with his denunciation of George Bush and the healthcare industry—will undoubtedly cause the right-wing media to erupt, and a fierce battle of words will be enjoined between Left and Right over how Mr. Stack should be categorized. This is quite pointless. In the end he will enter the pantheon of right-wing heros.\nWednesday, February 17, 2010\nComments Section taken over by aliens\nBut there are other options. If you're feeling disgruntled, let me know.\nTuesday, February 16, 2010\nIntroducing the Simply Appalling twought\nAs I have complained of myself in earlier posts, I have not been able to maintain the daily flow of writing that oozed out during the Bush years. Say what you will about George Bush, he was at least inspirational.\nStill I gasp at the news everyday, simply appalled. And by \"news\" I don't mean the real-world events that appal almost all of us—such as the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti—but the mad irreality of politics hurling us into abysses into which we need not go. Capitalism is the chief propellant, purchasing opinions and paying for their distribution throughout the American media and to a lesser degree throughout the media of other first-world nations.\nWealth and the power that attends it are now so concentrated that I'm not sure whether there is sufficient force to mount a credible resistance—at least in the \"developed\" countries. If there is, it will have to come from anger, desperation—and information. Anger and desperation, which we see for instance in the Tea Party movement, easily become merely ludicrous—not to mention exploitable—when the bearers of these sentiments are uninformed or misinformed, as most of us are.\nSo without much hope that the impetus toward neofeudalism can be halted, I'm picking up my proverbial pen again to \"rage against the dying of the light.\" But because I feel no more capable today than I did yesterday of producing lengthier pieces, I've decided to resort to the \"twought\" until such time as I may recover. The twought, in the Simply Appalling lexicon, is a writing that is somewhat longer than a \"tweet\" but shorter than a fully elaborated thought.\nPerhaps some commenter will provide the elaboration—or induce me to do it.\nMonday, February 15, 2010\nA note on Obama\nThe rank air of the decaying republic has left me almost constitutionally unable to write this past year. It is clear—wasn't it always?—that enough Democrats, especially in the Senate, were too frightened or bought off or indeed supportive of right-wing ideology to bring about the changes that the electorate so passionately hoped to see after the election of Barack Obama and a Democratic supermajority to the Senate.\nThe fault must be laid principally on Obama's doorstep. Obama was the first President elected by a clear popular majority (53.1%) since George H. Bush in 1988. It was an advantage that he promptly ignored, preferring instead to wallow in the rejection of his unrequited love offerings to the Republican mini-minority. Obama is sincere when he contends that his proposals have a lot in common with the Republicans', but he and his advisors are remarkably stupid for thinking that that is what matters to them.\nObama named the odious Rahm Emanuel to be his doorkeeper, which should have alerted the most ardent Obama supporters that they were being betrayed. He then appointed Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers to continue the Republican economic calamity. He left Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense to reassure the military-industrial barons that nothing would change on his watch and turned health care reform over to the Congress after arranging secret negotiations and giveaways to silence opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. After all these peace offerings to the right, he tried to induce a spirit of conviviality amongst his Republican opponents, apparently hoping to get them drunk at his cocktail parties. Needless to say, it didn't work.\nWhat Obama should have done was take a page from the Republican playbook and propel his agenda by the force of a committed constituency that was prepared to help him \"go all the way.\" This is a strategy that would have won him the \"populist\" label in the media and possibly gotten him assassinated. But he has already said he doesn't care if he's only a one-term President—it's the policy that counts.\nHe should have taken another page from the Republican playbook and used the always effective weapon of fear—but with a difference. He could have articulated the real risks we face rather than the ersatz bogeymen that Republicans manage to keep in the headlines.\nDid he want regulatory reform of the financial industry? The public was more than ready to back his demand. Do we need reform of the health care industry? It could have been—and should have been—presented as a matter of national defense during wartime. Want to rein in government waste? Explain the risks of the rising national debt and demand independent commissions to pour over the federal budget, including the Pentagon's. Call out the whistleblowers.\nAs he took office, the only thing Obama had to fear wasn't fear itself but fear misdirected. And he seems not to have seen it coming despite the right wing's history of using the tactic. Concerning health care reform, in short order the airwaves were full of talk of \"government death panels\" and the destruction of Medicare (yes, from Republicans who've been trying to kill the program since its inception!). And there are Republican-sponsored fear-filled analogues to be found for every item of candidate Obama's agenda.\nEffectively it is hard to distinguish the Obama administration from that of Bush, though to hear it told in the right-wing media you would think there had been a revolution. It is in fact the absence of one that will see a number of Democrats unelected quite soon.\nIn case you were looking to the Democrats for your salvation (8/19/05)\nMust-Read of the Day (9/08/07)\nQuote of the Day: On the political center of American politics (1/21/10)"}
{"text": "Experts endorse bill announced by Rep. George Miller\nWASHINGTON – Advocates struck a blow Thursday for protecting youth athletes from the devastating impact of concussion. Top experts gathered on Capitol Hill to explain why traumatic brain injury takes such a toll on individuals and society and to recommend federal legislation with certain key provisions. The briefing was sponsored by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the National Football League (NFL).\n“I’ve seen, too many times, the effects of concussion not only on professional athletes but on children and adolescents,” said Stanley Herring, M.D., FACSM, who serves on the NFL’s Head, Neck and Spine Medical Committee and is a team physician for the Seattle Seahawks and the Seattle Mariners. “The cost to individuals, their families, teams and communities is immense. I am proud that the NFL is the leader in concussion education and advocacy around the country and in Congress. The NFL’s good work will help protect athletes at all levels of sports.” Herring advocated for Washington State’s Zackery Lystedt Law, which has served as a model for similar legislation in other states.\n“Effective concussion policies for our student-athletes must include provisions to address the needs of the ‘student’ as well as the ‘athlete’ role. Education of school personnel, student-athletes, parents and coaches is the foundation. Proper recognition and removal of the athlete from play is an important first step, complemented by providing the necessary academic support for that student’s learning. These are both equally essential to facilitate recovery,” said Gerard Gioia, Ph.D., a pediatric neuropsychologist who earlier testified at a hearing of the House Labor and Education Committee. “The bill announced by Chairman (George) Miller (CA-7) includes these critical elements. This legislation promotes a better understanding of the academic and athletic consequences of concussions and the key supports for the student-athlete.”\nMedical experts were joined at the briefing by Sarah Rainey, a 15-year-old from Alexandria, VA, whose recovery from a soccer-field concussion took three months. Her story underscored the academic and social impacts of concussion, which can have an especially profound effect on a developing adolescent brain.\nSports-related concussions were brought into focus by recent studies showing their effects to be even more widespread and potentially more devastating than previously known. The National Football League has tightened concussion policies and encouraged governors to pass laws modeled on the Lystedt Law.\nSponsors and speakers of the Congressional briefing plan to continue advocating for state-by-state legislation modeled on the Lystedt Law while supporting appropriate federal concussion laws. The American College of Sports Medicine and other organizations have announced support for Rep. Miller’s “Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act.” Speakers at today’s briefing also spoke favorably of certain provisions in the ConTACT Act sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (NJ-8).\nThe American College of Sports Medicine is the largest sports medicine and exercise science organization in the world. More than 40,000 international, national, and regional members and certified professionals are dedicated to advancing and integrating scientific research to provide educational and practical applications of exercise science and sports medicine.\nThe National Football League is America's most popular sports league, comprising 32 franchises that compete each year to win the Super Bowl, the world's biggest annual sporting event. Founded in 1920, the NFL developed the model for the successful modern sports league, including extensive revenue sharing, competitive excellence, strong franchises across the board and national distribution. The NFL is the industry leader on a wide range of fronts. Business Week magazine calls the NFL \"one of America's best-run businesses.\""}

{"text": "June 28, 2012Early last month, I had the opportunity to be in a small group conversation with the president of one of the world’s great private universities. During the session, one of us asked the president what issue she was most concerned about and she immediately answered that it was the pressures on the public university system in the United States. She told us that her friends and colleagues leading those schools were facing enormous challenges such as the fiscal conditions of the states that support them and the rapidly changing nature of how learning is delivered.\nJust a few weeks later, a lot of what she was talking about played out in dramatic fashion at the University of Virginia. In case you missed it, here’s the quick summary. Over the course of several months, Helen Dragas, the chair of the University’s Board of Visitors, privately solicited the support of other members of the Board to force the recently hired president of UVA, Teresa Sullivan, out of her job. Dragas and others on the Board had concluded that Sullivan was not moving quickly enough to position UVA for a different future. Sullivan was apparently blindsided when Dragas told her that the Board was prepared to vote her out and gave her the opportunity to resign. It’s clear that the broader UVA community was blindsided. Faculty, students, alumni and state legislators rallied around Sullivan and two weeks after the Board forced her resignation, they voted, as the Washington Post summarizes here, to reinstate Sullivan as president.\nThere are so many leadership lessons and issues in this case that it’s impossible to address them all in one blog post so I’ll just focus on how Dragas handled this situation from beginning to end.\nYou Can’t Keep Secrets Anymore: In an age of radical transparency, why does any leader believe that they can make decisions that won’t eventually be exposed to the light of day? It was naïve of Dragas to think that she could hold a series of one off conversations with other Board members to force Sullivan out without that process being discovered. Even if you put the ethical issues aside for a moment, Dragas shouldn’t have operated in the way that she did because it just wasn’t practical. There are so many channels through which information can be leaked these days that you can’t keep secrets anymore.\nFairness Matters: When the word got out about how Dragas and other Board members forced Sullivan’s resignation, the outcry was swift and fierce. I think that was the case because most people have a pretty clear sense of what’s fair and what’s not. For instance, it’s not fair to have people sneaking around to force you out of your job when, by all reported accounts, they haven’t bothered to tell you that they didn’t think things were going so well. People have to trust you if your leadership is to be deemed credible and legitimate. That trust begins with a perception of fairness.\nThe Crowd Can Quickly Overwhelm You: As the controversy unfolded, it was interesting to see how Dragas dug in her heels. She hired the PR firm of Hill and Knowlton to help her defend her. Her public statements from that point were so carefully worded that they were almost a parody of corporate speak. None of that mattered in the end because her hand was forced by elected officials who pay attention to public opinion. Since the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2010, we’ve seen example after example of how the crowd can overwhelm bad leadership. How do you keep this from happening to you? See lessons one and two of this post for a start.\nWhat’s your take on the situation at UVA? What other lessons can leaders learn from the events there?\nJune 28, 2012"}
{"text": "In Nazi-occupied Warsaw during World War II, two resourceful keepers of the city's bombed-out zoo rescued Jews by smuggling them into empty animal enclosures. At a time when handing a thirsty Jew a cup of water was punishable by death, this brave Polish couple outwitted the surrounding Germans and spared the lives of some 300 people.\nThis remarkable true story is recounted in a new book, The Zookeeper's Wife, by naturalist, poet and essayist Diane Ackerman, author of the best-seller The Natural History of the Senses. Ackerman spent more than three years weaving this little-known chapter of history into an inspiring read that may join Schindler's List and Hotel Rwanda as popular accounts of heroism in the face of genocide.\n\"There's been so much written that it's hard to believe there are still little pockets of World War II history that are unknown,\" says Betsy Burton, owner of The King's English Bookshop in Salt Lake City. Burton believes The Zookeeper's Wife, crafted with Ackerman's trademark attention to sensory detail, may be her most accessible book yet. \"I think it'll have a broad appeal,\" she says. \"I couldn't put it down.\"\nAckerman will read from the book Monday night at The King's English to help celebrate the bookstore's 30th birthday. Burton and then-partner Ann Berman opened their shop in a cozy cottage on Sept. 10, 1977; in the three decades since, the store has survived by hand-selling favorites to loyal customers while hosting readings by everyone from John Irving to Sue Grafton to Nobel Prize-winning poets. Monday's event will mark Ackerman's first visit.\nThe author says she was led to Warsaw zookeepers Jan and Antonina Zabinski while researching a unique breed of wild horses from a primeval forest in eastern Poland. When Ackerman stumbled upon the Zabinskis and their wartime story, she was riveted.\n\"I woke up one morning and discovered I was coming down with a book,\" she says by phone from her home in Ithaca, N.Y. \"It was like a telegram had been slipped under the door of my subconscious.\"\nThrough her research, Ackerman learned that despite the loss of most of their zoo animals, the Zabinskis maintained a small but colorful menagerie in their wartime villa: a badger that slept atop the piano, a piglet who played with their young son and a carnivorous rabbit that swiped meat off dinner plates. These animals mingled with the dozens of Jews the Zabinskis sequestered in their home to create a bustling but welcome atmosphere of surprising innocence during a time of war.\nThe Zookeeper's Wife details how Jan Zabinski helped the Polish resistance by storing explosives in the elephant enclosure - a fact he even kept secret from his wife - and sneaking Jews from the Warsaw ghetto into the zoo, where he gave them animal code names and hid them successfully for years. His wife, Antonina, meanwhile, used her rare charm and intuitiveness to soothe their anxious guests and keep their war-torn household together. Thanks to her copious diaries, which Ackerman read in translation, Antonina emerges as the book's most compelling character.\n\"She was a woman of extraordinary empathy and who had a special gift for calming animals,\" says Ackerman, who considers Antonina a soulmate. \"And they responded to her in an almost magical way.\"\nAlthough Jan and Antonina Zabinski died in the 1970s, Ackerman was able to reconstruct their thoughts and feelings about their wartime experiences. She toured today's Warsaw zoo, interviewed the Zabinskis' surviving son and read accounts of their exploits in foreign newspapers. Thanks to this research and her narrative storytelling approach - a departure from Ackerman's previous books - The Zookeeper's Wife reads more like fiction than history.\n\"The true story is so powerful and poignant. It's a story of great compassion and great courage,\" says Ackerman, who was careful to stick to the facts as she knew them. \"Yes, it does sound like a novel, because their life was like that. But if I had written it as a novel, people would have said, 'Oh, she's making this up.' \"\nDiane Ackerman reads\n* Diane Ackerman will read from and sign her new book, The Zookeeper's Wife, Monday at 7 p.m. at The King's English Bookshop, 1511 S. 1500 East, Salt Lake City.\n* The bookstore will celebrate its 30th birthday all day Monday with 30 percent discounts on any book in stock (except Ackerman titles)."}

Although most people are conscious of this, they often treat sleep like it is not a necessary function.

A lack of sleep will often cause low energy levels during the day and create a poor mood and lack of mental acuity. Since the body also uses that time to physically recover and rebuild tissue, a lack of sleep can slow down the healing process for wounds and injuries.\nOver time poor sleeping habits can aggravate some mood disorders and psychological problems such as depression or bipolar disorder. Poor sleeping habits has also been linked to heart arrhythmia, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even obesity. It has been estimated that poor sleeping habits have contributed to over $16 billion of healthcare costs related to the aforementioned health problems.

{"text": "RMA: Less than 1 in 5 consumers is 'tire smart'\nThe summer driving season officially has begun, but many Americans will be wasting gas and putting themselves at risk because they're driving on poorly maintained, improperly inflated tires.\n“No road trip should start without first checking tire pressure and inspecting tires for damage and insufficient tread depth,” says Dan Zielinski, senior vice president of public affairs for the Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA.) “Vehicles with under inflated tires burn more gas and have a greater risk of tire damage that may lead to failure. Consumers who are tire smart and maintain tires will help keep their families safe, keep more money in their wallet and help the environment.”\nA 2015 RMA survey found that more than 30% of U.S. drivers are less concerned about gas mileage performance since gas prices have dropped over the past year. A whopping 50% of drivers aged 18-29 say they are unconcerned with gas mileage performance.\n“Tire care shouldn’t take a back seat because of lower gas prices,” Zielinski says. “National Tire Safety Week is May 24-30 and is a good time to start a habit of regular, monthly tire maintenance to help promote safety, save money at the gas pump and help tires last.”\nRMA survey findings include:\n- Only 17% of drivers are “tire smart” or know how to properly check tire pressure.\n- 1 out of 3 drivers don’t know that tires should be checked “cold” – before driving.\n- 35% of drivers do not know how to tell if their tires are bald.\n- Nearly 6 out of 10 drivers do not check the tire pressure in their spare tire.\n- 4 in 10 drivers believe they can tell if a tire is under inflated just by looking at it.\n- Half of all drivers don’t know where to find the correct inflation pressure for their vehicle. (Label on a vehicle’s driver side door or owner’s manual; not tire sidewall.)\nNational Tire Safety Week is an RMA initiative designed to educate motorists about proper tire maintenance. The effort is part of RMA’s Be Tire Smart – Play Your PART national consumer education program. PART is an acronym representing Pressure, Alignment, Rotation and Tread – the four key elements of tire care.\nFor more information about the RMA, visit www.rma.org."}

{"text": "Part of the \"Critiques of Libertarianism\" site.\nLast updated 10/25/07.\n[This was a letter from Mike O'Mara published in the March, 1997 issue of Libertarian Party News. Reproduced with permission of the author. Interestingly, it is absent from the online version of Libertarian Party News.]\nShould the Libertarian Party be called \"The Party Without Principle?\" The nickname of the Party has long been \"The Party of Principle\". But, ironically, the Party really doesn't seem to rest on any kind of clear principle at all.\nThe entire economic platform of the Libertarian Party requires that people have the right to own \"justly acquired property\". But, amazingly, the Party has never specified any principle for determining what is meant by \"justly acquired property\". As a result, it really appears to be the Party Without Principle, so far.\nIn fact, the only clear principle of justly acquired property that has ever been presented is that of John Locke. But the Party has never taken a stand for or against Locke's principle of property rights, and has never offered an alternative principle.\nLocke's principle of property rights is that justly acquired property is created when a person mixes one's labor with land and natural resources, to produce property. For example, if a farmer mixes labor with the soil to produce corn, the corn is the farmer's justly acquired property. After that, the farmer would have the right to keep the corn, or to sell or give it to anyone the farmer chooses.\nLocke added that, since land (meaning a volume of space, and the natural resources in it) was not produced by any person, each individual must have a right to equal access to land and natural resources.\nHow then can Locke's principle of property rights be applied? It would be too difficult to divide the land periodically, because of the buildings on the land. Thomas Paine and Henry George proposed that, instead of dividing the land, we can divide the rent from land. The rent would be based on the market rental value of the location of land (not the buildings).\nOnly those who own land of more than average market rental value would wind up paying any net rent - to those they have displaced from using an equal share of land.\nGovernment would not play any role in this. It would not receive any of the land rent, or even distribute it, and it would not assess the land rent. The land rental value would be assessed by the market, through a system of competing land assessors.\nThose who disagree with Locke's principle of justly acqured property (and Paine and George's application of it) are obligated to present a consistent alternative principle. So far, no one ever has. If the Libertarian Party really wants to be The Party of Principle, it needs to either adopt Locke's principle of property rights, or offer a consistent alternative principle.\nCopyright 2007 by Mike Huben ( email@example.com ).\nThis document may be freely distributed for non-commercial purposes if it is reproduced in its textual entirety, with this notice intact."}

Extracts from banaba leaves have been reported to reduce diabetic symptoms in genetically diabetic mice (Type II, KK-Ay). In the present study, female mice of the same strain showing remarkable body weight gain were used to examine the antiobesity effect of dietary banaba extract. Five-week-old female KK-Ay mice were fed a control diet or test diet containing 5% of a hot-water extract from banaba leaves instead of cellulose for 12 wk. Neither group showed any changes in diet intake during the experimental period. Body weight gain and parametrial adipose tissue weight were lowered significantly in the banaba diet group. Blood glucose levels were not suppressed in the banaba diet group, but hemoglobin A1C was found to be suppressed at the end of the experiment. No effects on the serum lipids were observed, but the mice fed banaba extract showed a significant decrease, to 65% of the control level in total hepatic lipid contents. This decrease was due to a reduction in the accumulation of triglyceride. These results suggest that banaba had a beneficial effect on obese female KK-Ay mice."}
{"text": "Long a prominent issue in the K-12 educational space, the issue of bullying is being thrust into the national spotlight as the country’s most popular professional sports league begins an investigation into accusations of rampant bullying among its players.\nSI.com is reporting that Miami Dolphins starting offensive lineman Jonathan Martin voluntarily left the team after being the target of extreme bullying at the hands of teammates. Martin reported that he was forced to pay $15,000 to fund a player trip to Las Vegas that he was not permitted to attend, and that all of his teammates got up and left the dining area when he sat down at team meals. Martin alleges that the ringleader of the bullying was fellow starting lineman Richie Incognito.\nIncognito is being accused of personally bullying Martin both in person and via digital communications. Jason La Canfora of CBS, relying on multiple sources, reported that Martin provided the Dolphins and the NFL with several texts allegedly sent to him by Incognito. Those messages are reported to include racial slurs, as well as threats to both Martin (who is bi-racial) and his family.\nLa Canfora added, “There are several instances of threats as well, the sources said, and overall disturbing exchanges.”\nIncognito was kicked off the teams at Nebraska and Oregon before being voted by fellow NFL players as the second “dirtiest” player in the league several years ago.\nFor his part, Incognito has maintained his innocence, at one point taking to Twitter to demand that the various media outlets reporting the story clear his name. In one Tweet he wrote, “@espn @CBSSports @NBCSports @FOXSports @ProFootballTalk I want my name CLEARED.”\nShortly thereafter, the Dolphins released a statement revealing that Incognito was being indefinitely suspended. The statement, in part, read, “We believe in maintaining a culture of respect for one another and as a result, we believe this decision is in the best interest of the organization at this time. As we noted earlier, we reached out to the NFL to conduct an objective and thorough review. We will continue to work with the league on this matter.”\nAs the Martin case is similar in many ways to instances of bullying that take place in the K-12 classroom, EducationWorld offers the following questions to help frame class discussion:\nThis site addresses fraternity, sorority, athletic, high school and military hazing. Users can check out the latest hazing books, find anti-hazing speakers, identify alternatives to hazing and share their thoughts with other visitors.\nBullyHelp assists school counselors in identifying students who desperately need help with school bullying. Because the greatest allies in the battle against bullying are the students who witness incidents, programs offered by the site encourage those witnesses to get help for bullying targets.\nHazingPrevention.org is a national organization dedicated to empowering people to prevent hazing. Although it is a young organization, HazingPrevention has already established three major national efforts—National Hazing Prevention Week, the Novak Institute for Hazing Prevention and a growing number of webinars."}
{"text": "Not a JDate ad, a new “minority classification” at the City University of New York, and some who prefer to stick with preexisting minority classifications are not happy:\nTouting a move to make its faculty more diverse, CUNY administrators have broken out Jews into a separate minority group: “White/Jewish.” …\n“This is, as far as I know, the first time a religion has been introduced into any affirmative-action document,” said David Gordon, a history professor at Bronx Community College and the Graduate Center. “What would the response be to a category ‘White/Methodist?’ Silly? Irrelevant?”\n“It’s an insult and idiotic,” said Hershey Friedman, deputy chairman of the Finance and Business Management Department at Brooklyn College. “Most Jews are brown-skinned. We also have black Jews and Asian Jews. Once you mix religion with race you’re opening a Pandora’s box — and you look stupid.” …\nThe new White/Jewish category is discussed in a report on CUNY’s Diversity Action Plan, issued last month by CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein. The plan is aimed at boosting the recruitment and inclusion of minorities.\nA steering committee led by Joyce Moy, director of CUNY’s Asian Research Institute, ran faculty focus groups based on “identity.” The groups included “African-American/black, Asian, White/Jewish, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender, Hispanic/Latino, Individuals with disabilities, and Italian-American.”\nCUNY targets Italian-Americans for affirmative action in response to lawsuits alleging bias….\n“White,” said a Jewish professor at Kingsborough Community College, “is in every way a detriment to be categorized because of the push to hire minorities.”\nHow is it any different from African-American?\nTrue story. We had a student live with us who had a South African mother and an American father. She grew up in South Africa, but had dual passports. She was African-American. And as pale white as Elizabeth Warren.\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.\nProfessor, this only matters to people of character. Those lacking same see this as another path to supremacy.\nIs that similar to “white hispanic”? How about white American next? How about stopping this nonsense NOW! Who are these stupid people who think these things up? Are they tenured?\nI’m a black man originally from the Dominican Republic; last week I was at a hospital in Baltimore, MD (I’m a new father) and a official came up with some forms that I had to fill; she asked me questions about my ethnicity (“Are you hispanic/latino?”), to which I answered yes and then the next question was about my race to which I responded “black”. She gave me this weird look and told me that her computer does not allow that selection when you select “hispanic” as your ethnicity. She told me that in race she will have to select “other” and manually input “black/hispanic”… and so a new category is added to the American melting pot…\nCongratulations on your new child!\nLast time I purchased a firearm, the seller insisted that I had to designate an ethnicity, after I initially refused.\nI decided I would be a Pacific Islander. Cowabunga, dude.\nYou are dead right about “new categories” being defined in America, by the government no less. If you look at the US Census exerpt document I cited, notice how far off kilter the “race” section has become. For example: just how, is a Korean a different “race” than a Japanese or Chinese?\nAdding “white/Jewish” is just another layer of ignorance, no doubt soon to be adopted by government, too. There’s a dangerous precedent for that … for marking any group by race & religion for that matter. What is next, yellow Magen David patches for “white/Jews” to wear? Perhaps some yellow crosses for “white/Catholics” to wear? Maybe a yellow “X” for “white/African-Americans” (as cited by the Prof) to wear?\nThe next time I’m given one of these forms to fill out I intend to check “other” and fill in “Homo Erectus” for my race.\n“It’s an insult and idiotic,” said Hershey Friedman, deputy chairman of the Finance and Business Management Department at Brooklyn College. “Most Jews are brown-skinned. We also have black Jews and Asian Jews. Once you mix religion with race you’re opening a Pandora’s box — and you look stupid.”\nYou know CUNY, is just a few letters away, from something Maggot Maher would say..\nThis is how all this nonsense will end.\nIt had become a parody.\n1. I hope you’re right.\nThe alternative is that, if it isn’t already, it will become entrenched like Jim Crow. It’s part of the spoils system that holds the leftist coalition together. Actions like CUNY’s help force a resolution one way or another. Let’s see if the Left finds yet another excuse to dodge the issue.\n2. Imagine the shrieks of antisemitism if a conservative institution had done this.\n3. Upscale Jewish liberals, the kind who “live like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans”, have been supping with the collectivist devil for longer than a reasonable person can excuse. I have no sympathy if their chickens come home to roost (which remains to be seen).\n… “live like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans” …\nPerfect description.. Please to not mind if I steal it for frequent use.\nIt’s not for me to mind because I didn’t coin the phrase (hence my quotation marks). Google it and see. I’m glad you like it but don’t know who originated it.\nI fear a white Catholic like myself will never be a minority.\nIf you could just manage lactation…THEN you’d have something!\nAll of this could be solved if only someone had “a dream that [his] four little children [could] one day[*] live in a nation where they [would] not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”\nBut where could we ever find such a dreamer?\n*For certain that “one day” will never arrive so long as liberals/leftists occupy themselves in their foolish and vain attempts of coming up with ways of “making life better.”\nAn excellent website for delving into the inanity of the left in the discrimination and AA fields is,\nlt is incomprehesible to me. How black americans , 150 years out of slavery , 50 years out of jim crow- segregation , have been 90+% hell bent on putting themselves along with the rest of us into servitude to a central authority. Since they started down this path 50 years ago the results have told a story of increasing destruction. This last , but 1st black overlord . is being the most devastating overlord for them of all. Yet in a few months they will overwhelmingly vote for him again. l just dont get it.\nIt’s rather ironic that American Jews, most of whom descend from people who fled anti-Semitism in Russian Empire, which included quotas, are so eager to embrace affirmative action.\nI knew a young woman from Botswana who had Dutch ancestry and considered herself African American.\nJohn Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz, is an Portuguese-African (born in Mozambique), who happens to live in the USA, making her as African-American as Warren is Indian-American.\nAs I recall, Mrs. Heinz once mentioned being African-American when her husband, John Kerry was running for President. She was quickly told to drop that line.\nDear Elizabeth Warren,\nRecently, it has come to my attention that City University of New York (CUNY) has added a minority category of White/Jewish. I’m wondering whether if I might qualify. The last that I looked in a mirror I seem to qualify “White,” although it’s uncertain what proof might actually be required of me because I am male. Also, I have read the Torah, although not in Hebrew. Do you think this is a problem? If not, could I qualify as “Jewish”? I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience. Hey, good luck with that whole Cherokee thing. You’re truly an inspiration. Yours,\n“This is, as far as I know, the first time a religion has been introduced into any affirmative-action document,” said David Gordon, a history professor at Bronx Community College and the Graduate Center.”\nWhat part of “WASP” doesn’t he understand?

I chose “Other/Scandinavian”.\nIncidentally, they were pleased with that: It meant one more ‘minority’ they could count. I was told that their Federal Aid was directly tied to the number of ‘Minorities’ they reported. It was all supposed to be confidential, so we were encouraged to check one of the ‘minority’ boxes so the School would get more money, and they could ‘keep tuition down’.\nMaybe… just maybe… Mrs. Warren was actually trying to do something altruistic with her claims of being an Ancient American or whatever the Great Minds have decided we are supposed to refer to them as.\n“as pale white as Elizabeth Warren”. Just couldn’t resist, could you?\n“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race (and religion) is to stop discriminating on the basis of race (and religion).”\nChief Justice John Roberts with a little help from me.\nSo if you are Sephardic can you put down Black/Jewish?\nIn New Jersey (at least in the Democratic primaries) they have a Jewish distinction too.\nOff topic: Holder vs. Axelrod going at it?\nI’m 1/8 Jewish from my mother’s side so I qualify, right?\nWhere does all this racial/ethnic bookeeping end up?\nLike Dizzy Miss Lizzy, I guess I should be in a quest to meet people just like me … 1/2 German, 1/4 Czech, 1/8 Jewish, and 1/8 French.\nSo many fractions involved! How do I find them? Oh, yeah. I already have … the siblings I’m so often trying to get away from!\nStop the madness! We’re all Americans!\nIf acting colorblind means closing your eyes, then keep your eyes closed! I want to evaluate people one at a time, as individuals.\nThe only time I give in and take them to task as a group, is when they insist on being defined as a group.\nI can’t stand it anymore …\nHey, I’m 1/4 Czech too. Welcome, my brother. *fist bump*\nUnless of course you’re not Bohemian like me and are instead Moravian or some other, lesser, Czech variant. In which case you must become my mortal enemy.\nI’m 1/4 Bohemian, … my sister!\nNadivka is the only kind of stuffing I’ll eat!\nUnless of course you’re not Bohemian like me and are instead Moravian or some other, lesser, Czech variant. In which case you must become my mortal enemy.\nSo the Czechs, not content to have the Slovaks leave their confederation, are now trying to tick the Moravians off as well?\nOther Slavonic populations behave the same way.\nIn contrast, twenty years ago some observers described West Germany’s acceptance of impoverished East Germany as economically ruinous. The Germans took the bull by the horns, and once again they are the dominant state in Europe.\nDuring the SCOTUS hearing on the Univ of Michigan quota system (I forget how many years ago) there was a brief that the original entrance criteria for quotas (before they were illegal) for Harvard Law School was put in place to screen out too many overachieving New York Jews.\nHarvard, likely the other Ivies as well, did the same to Catholics. For a little history on this as it related to Boston College (which rumor has it was once a Catholic school; fortunately those in charge of its present form have pledged allegiance to political correctness and have done their best to shake off such shameful history), see this article,\nAffirmative action is an anti-merit quota system. It galls me.\nI grew up in a large farm family (the “chicken farming Jews”, immigrants, in upstate New York.) As a kid, my father dreamed of going to Cornell, but when he finished high school, he didn’t make the cut under the Jewish quota system.\nHe never got over the disappointment, and he never did go to college. We grew up on this story, and as kids had it hammered into us to study hard, how wonderful that “times had changed”. Most of my sibs in fact did end up going to Cornell on free rides with full academic scholarships, four of them through professional degrees. (The eldest grandchild also became a Cornell valedictorian, sort of ending the Cornell enthusiasm for the rest of this generation. They picked other universities. :-))\nBut the point is, we all internalized the idea as a value that hard work and achievement will be rewarded, and I guess with that a loathing and fear of quota systems. For affirmative action, supposedly to thwart entrenched subtle advantages of legacy and white maleness, a generation or two of “catch up” should have been sufficient. We’re now into the third generation. Diversity goals were to have been a means, not an end. Enough.\n[…] programs are getting more and more farcical. The City University of New York has now added “White Jews” to the various groups with minority status. At CUNY, “Italian-Americans” are […]\nWilliam, there’s a typo:\n… an student …\nTrue story. We had an student live\nYears ago I had a colleague at major U of “x” who was from Italy and had a name which could be interpreted as Spanish. His wife got back something or other classifying her as “Hispanic.” She was born German, and raised in Germany, blonder than Lizzie Warren.\nSince my relatives could have been Vikings hundreds of years ago, is it possible I am part Turkish, or No. African, or Indian (some got to Newfoundland) or Arab, or… I want my privileges too.\nIdiocy is a progressive condition.\nThe only minority of consequence is the individual. Anything else is prejudiced and serves to denigrate individual dignity and devalue human life.\nTheir concept of diversity is similarly degenerate. They prioritize a diversity of incidental features over diversity of thought engendered by an individual.\nHuman beings are not interchangeable. We cannot be reasonably classified by our incidental features. They do not define us.\nMorons, one and all. This nonsense has to end. The progress from exceptional discrimination to institutional discrimination marks an extraordinary regression in human and civil rights.\nThis is weird on a number of levels, including the professors’ apparent ignorance that Jews are indeed a race. Not all Jews with an identifiable and traceable gene practice Judaism, and of course many (converted) practicing Jews don’t have the gene. But all those with the gene are deemed “Jewish.” Together, you end up with somewhere in the neighborhood, worldwide, of 13 million Jews–less than two-tenths of one percent of the world’s population.\nI agree wholeheartedly that affirmative action based on any criterion with the possible (and defensible) exception of African Americans is silly. Which is what makes the Lizzie Warren saga so amusing. But by the rules established and currently in operation, there’s no reasonable argument for excluding Jews.\nWhy is discrimination to offer advantage to Blacks justified? There were Blacks who were slavers, including members of Obama’s ancestral tribe (Luo). There were Whites who were slaves. Why the arbitrary distinction between one slave and another? How can it be reasonably justified to recognize discrimination against Blacks but not Whites? It is not defensible at all. If we follow this standard, then we are all tainted by the sins of our ancestors, including American Indians, Muslims, etc.\nThe rules established and currently in operation must be rejected, ironically, with prejudice.\nOnly a tiny part of me believes that you believe what you just wrote (and that you aren’t being sarcastic in ways that I adore). So to that minuscule part, I’ll say only that Muslims aren’t a race–and that Muslim Arabs are notorious for discriminating against, and murdering, Christian Arabs. Now what?\nWhat’s your point? Do you assign or presume guilt of individuals or of classes? Do you believe that the sins of the father are conferred on the son? Do you respect individual dignity and what compromises do you accept to accommodate billions of individuals each with a unique dignity? What principles guide your ideology?\nFor the example you cited, upon proof, you hold the individuals accountable. If it is murder, then then murderer is put to death. However, we do not presume guilt. Even in war, there is an effort made to distinguish between individuals in the field.\nWhat are you on about? Let me repeat myself:\n“I agree wholeheartedly that affirmative action based on any criterion with the possible (and defensible) exception of African Americans is silly. Which is what makes the Lizzie Warren saga so amusing.”\nJim Crow lasted more than a century after the Civil War, as did covenants in the North. It’s a defensible argument for American blacks. Defensible isn’t necessarily the same as being right.\nre: Cassandra Lite | June 4, 2012 at 1:50 am\nI do not consider denigration of individual dignity to be a defensible proposition. It is, however, lucrative in both economic and political terms. There is a better way to handle exceptional discrimination, and it is not through the establishment or perpetuation of institutional discrimination. The current policies and programs serve to perpetuate prejudice with the presumption of guilt. This is or should be unacceptable.\nI should specify that “professors'” refers to the academics quoted in the story, not Prof. Jacobson.\nThe first time I read that original comment, my eyes zipped back to check the placement of the apostrophe lest it be LI apostasy.\nIt’s not “political correctness”. It is more correct to describe it as progressive corruption… of individuals and society. It is a fundamental corruption, which threatens the viability of a society and humanity.\nRecognizing a white/Jewish category is long overdue.\nJews have suffered terrible discrimination throughout history and deserve special consideration for school admission and jobs in America, although they have become too successful in recent times and shouldn’t receive as many diversity points as white Hispanics, for example, who, in turn, deserve fewer than brown Hispanics.\nBlack Jews are mostly stigmatized for their skin color and so are already given racial preference. Asian Jews have too many advantages and probably shouldn’t take minority slots away from the black and white Jews.\nOne of the reasons for considering white Jews a minority group is that it paves the way for us to finally recognize Arab-Americans as a people who experience terrible prejudice and unequal opportunity. The Chamber of Commerce is now considering such a move that would help Arab businessmen have a well-deserved hand up over regular white/white non-Jew Americans.\nBest, though, is that white/ Jew recognition will lead to white/ Muslim becoming an official minority. They have endured terrible prejudice in America, especially since 9-11, and deserve preferential placement on campus and in government offices.\nAffirmative action, quotas and preferences are needed until America is truly diverse and minorities may, one day, enjoy majority standing.\nSo, you reject individual dignity? As you perceive individuals to form a collective through arbitrary classifications, do you also recognize that Muslims and Arabs enslaved Europeans, Africans, Indians, etc. by the millions? That they failed in their genocidal ambitions only by virtue of Europeans and other populations joining together and rejecting Islamic tyranny? Shouldn’t everyone be held equally accountable for the sins of their ancestors? Perhaps Muslims and Arabs deserve a special designation as they continue in their old ways of murder, rape, torture, and enslavement of whole populations.\nThat takes us deeper into mixing ethnicity and religion to arrive at “aggrieved minorities”. What next, white/Jehovah’s Witnesses, Hispanic/Jehovah’s Witnesses, black/Jehovah’s Witnesses, Asian/Jehovah’s Witnesses, ‘other’/Jehovah’s Witnesses… I maintain that there are fewer J-Dubs than Muslims, and they may be just as reviled. Recall that Hitler went after them early on, along with the Jews and Gypsies.\nAnd much of the Islamists’ wounds are self-inflicted by their ideology. Of the 50-60 wars/conflicts in the world all but a handful involve Muslims’ inability to get along with their neighbors and fellow citizens.\nWhere does it end?\nYou are correct regarding the bulk of Muslim grievances … they are self inflicted. I’ve said as much in my comments following this one. I live in a Muslim community and can confidently assert that they discriminate amongst each other more than anyone else. Put a bunch of Iraqis, Lebanese, Yemeni,and sundry Palestinian Arabs in a room together and you have the ingredients for instant fist fight. It’s kind of like Italians, Irish, and Puerto Ricans … 🙂\nThe ignorance you display is outright astounding. Just what is your experience in the American Muslim, ne’ “white/Muslim” community? I suspect your opinion is academic. Mine is based upon living, for over 25 years, in the largest concentration of American Muslims in the United States. My “hood” is about 90% Shiite at the moment. May I tell you that you are full of crap about massive discrimination against Muslims? CAIR, who you sound like you read up on, is a political agenda outfit that represents almost no ordinary Muslims, here or anywhere else … anymore than Jesse and Al represent regular black folks.\nDon’t you think it telling that you worked in “Shiite” and “crap” in the same sentence?\nAnd per your self-description and photo in the comment below, I should think you’d qualify for official disability preference as the most hirsute Irish Catholic ever to type gibberish on a keyboard.\nMuslims are treated worse than Catholics because no one has a problem with tradition-bound RC women covering their heads for church, but when Muslim women are modestly clothed according to their beliefs, the Christianist police want to force them to expose their heads for “identification.” purposes.\nReading is not your strong point I see. “Crap” and “Shiite” are not in the same sentence. A period usually defines the end of a sentence. There is a period between the two statements you cite…the second being an interrogatory.\nAnd you did not answer the first question. What are you sources for your assertions? Things you’ve read or things you’ve lived?\nWhere in the United States are “Christianist police” demanding hijab be removed? Or are you referring to the niqab. Do you know the difference?\nThe photo you refer to …. is that my avatar, which is a picture of one of my German Shepherds, from a Jewish breeder. Yep, odd I am, Irish, Catholic leaning, dude with a Jewish bred dog, (and another Czech bred), living in a Arab Muslim neighbor hood …and liking it. I have no problems, my neighbors have no problems. You seem to have the problem.\nFirst, I stand corrected: Same line. We OK now? But, my, you’re pretty out of sorts over periods.\nSecond, you are being corrected: I do not make assertions which, like your assumptions, would make an ass out of you, me and the historical record. I deal in fact, whereas it is your side that is not reality-based.\nThird: This country was founded on and forged by Christianity, and the fact of some early Deist founding fathers doesn’t change the Cristo-theological bent of American culture ever since. The police are coercive functionaries of the de facto Judeo-Christian State, and they are notorious for discriminating against minorities. Even the black and hispanic police do profiling (as do neighborhood white hispanic watchmen/ murderers.)\nFourth: Devout Muslim women have not only been forced to remove their veils but their entire hijabs for body searches. In prison, they are forced to wear western man-like garb and only through lawsuits are allowed to wear their headscarves/ niqabs. The system is not multiculturally sensitive, because it is was designed by white Christianists.\n“Fifth”: You must be drinking one, or maybe having to take it in court under oath. You haven’t convinced anyone of your multiculti bonafides by invoking dangerous fascist animals, privileged ancestors, and neighbors whose racial and religious plight you apparently refuse to recognize and make amends for.\nFTS … you’ve not answered my question regarding your bona fides, but wish to challenge mine? You say I am “being corrected’ but offer no evidence to support your correction. So be it. Your argument is so cliché’ it is amusing. As I’ve said, I live my positions, you either read yours, or imagine them.\nI do believe you are a freshman college student with one cultural anthropology course under your belt.\nYours very truly,\nAridog: A coercive functionary of the de facto Judeo-Christian State,and proud of it.\nBTW … I am of Irish descent, and Catholic orientation…only slightly whiter than Lizzy Warren….and I like living here, do not intend to move. I find your conclusion that diversity isn’t achieved until a minority achieves majority standing amusing. It’s your “tell” … do you want to tell us what “majority standing ” means to you?\nTo all good people with common sense, logic, reason, etc, of course this is stupid, crazy, idiotic, etc.. but to the liberals, this is standard normal rationale theory and strategic tactics of divide and conquer put into practice and execution, which is what liberal race, gender, and class warfare is all about, their agenda.\nWhom do liberals consider their enemy, white religious conservatives, so they they target people into selected groups and categories to purposely divide them by their race, ethnicity, creed, color, gender, and combined with their religious affiliation, makes it even more distinct in who and what they are, and is how people can be targeted out and labeled for specific prejudice, bias, coercion, intimidation, etc., just like Hitler and the Nazi’s did with the Jews..\nThis all part of their strategy that must essentially be sanctioned by authority, specifically govt. authority, to make it legitimate and normal in practice.\nDistinct separation of people into categories and subcategories for human identification is what they politically want.. ie; separating and labeling their political targets.\nIf anyone thinks this is just a passing error in judgement, or political correctness gone wild, are seriously naive, mistaken, or are part of the plan and people actively who implement that plan.\nThe only way for it to stop, is for the conservative politicians and overwhelming mass of people to rise up and demand this practice be abolished, as well as being against the law.\nThe People / the Majority of the populace, had better wake up and realize they are at war with a ruthless and radical subversive element in the nation, or it will be too late by the time they do, if they do. just like the innocent people of Europe in the early 20t century found out too late.\nThey are opportunistic. It is notable that the people who advocate and defend these schemes recognize their individual dignity before all others. They know how to manipulate people in order to induce prejudice. They thrive on commission of emotional extortion. Perhaps they learned something from the German socialists’ experiments. I wouldn’t doubt that was the motivation for their degenerate methods and policies.\nThey have normalized involuntary exploitation.\nThey have normalized institutional discrimination by classes, including: race, skin color, gender, etc.\nTheir policies sponsor progressive corruption of individuals, society, and humanity. It is a fundamental corruption which they justify through a selective recall of history, science, and reality. Unfortunately, a large minority which dreams of instant gratification willingly supports this process, and too many others have been cowed into submission.\nBy the way, nice op-ed in the NYPost.\nWhen oh when will the left give up the racial gerrymandering and the one drop rule?\nWhite/Black = Valerie Jarrett ?\nIn the end, isn’t this all just profiling? Isn’t profiling looked down upon by the left?\nYet they WANT to profile when it comes to college admissions, giving special status?!?!\n“Whenever this issue of compensatory or preferential treatment for the Negro is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror. The Negro should be granted equality, they agree; but he should ask for nothing more. On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic. For it is obvious that if a man is entering the starting line in a race 300 years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.”\nVis a vis time of entering the race, etc… should we presume the author of the quote does not believe in out of Africa evolution in any way? Can we assume that after the 300 years that the aggrieved will have caught up and then be done with all this nonsense? Or 600 years? Or ever?\nIt boils down to a simpler concept, equal opportunity. That is what we must assure, regardless of race, ethnicity or religion. Equal opportunity does not mean equal outcomes. I have a lot in common with Kanye West, (piggy attitude and lousy voice) but he’s far richer than I am. We’ve both had equal opportunity. When do I get to catch up?\nEnough with this nonsensical shibboleth, already.\nEach man starts for himself when he is born.\nLet’s see, kids I know personally:\nTwo red headed, freckled 1/8 Native Americans (tribal memberships) who went to expensive private school from kindergarten on, whose father is a partner at a major US law firm, making well over 1 million a year. (Duke)\nOne lily-white 1/2 Hispanic whose father’s family were German Jews who immigrated to Mexico before WWII- educated at private school K-12- father is respected doctor. (NYU)\nOne lily-white 1/2 Hispanic who never used father’s Latino surname (divorced parents) until she began taking SATs. (Princeton)\nTwo 1/8 Native American (tribal membership) blond and blue eyed (whiter than Elizabeth Warren), private schools, heirs to oil company and football team. (Vanderbilt)\nOne Hispanic whose father is of Russian Jewish descent, owns apartments in Paris, spends a month at Hotel du Cap in summer.\nAnd, it goes on and on………………………\nPretty soon the only unemphasized minority available to be pandered to will be the actual basic American.\nEh, whot?! You mean your basic “coercive functionaries of the de facto Judeo-Christian State” [quoth *Full-Throated Support*]?? The diaspora of my Fir Bolg descendants will be left out again 🙂\nEr … change that “descendants” to “ancestors.”\n[…] the future, everybody will be a minority for 15 minutes. City University of New York now has White/Jewish category for its faculty. And if CUNY decides to break off Jews into a […]"}
{"text": "Wondering what the Federal Trading Commission, or FTC, is up to these days? It’s going undercover to ensure data brokers are in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nAnd so far, the government agency isn’t liking what’s it’s discovering. Several years ago, police departments across the country would often ask high school kids who looked older than they were to help them. They wanted them to go into local convenience stores and attempt to buy beer. That didn’t last long once the lawyers began pointing out the liability of doing such things; it was a moment in time that was quickly forgotten. Now, though, it looks as though the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, is doing something similar.\nBypassing Fair Credit Reporting Law\nThe investigations have so far shown that at least ten data brokers are potentially bypassing the FCRA – and it’s only just begun the investigation. What ultimately happens remains to be seen, partly because of the less than aggressive letter it recently sent to those found violating the law.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act was signed into law in an effort of better protecting the privacy and other rights of consumers.\nThe ten data brokers who were clearly not adhering to the Act have already been sent letters. Those letters explain how the FTC came across the information and provided instances of how each was breaking compliance. Data brokering companies that collect, distribute or sell this information are considered consumer reporting agencies under the FCRA. That means they’re held to high standards when it comes to protecting American consumers and their identifiable information, including their financial documents.\nThe Sting Operation\nHere’s how it works – staff members with the Federal Trade Commission were sent into the offices with the goal of securing information on consumers. They said they represented different companies and that the information would be used to “to make decisions related to their creditworthiness, eligibility for insurance or suitability for employment,” the agency explained. Instead of making reasonable efforts to verify the identities of those seeking the information and ensuring their purposes for wanting it was legal, the brokers provided the information with little or no resistance.\nTherefore, the brokers had no idea whether or not they’d just released the information to hackers or others with less than legal purposes. The requirement was put into place to ensure sensitive information as well as the privacy of consumers was always protected. This includes their credit histories and scores, the information on the credit accounts, including mortgages and credit cards, as well as social security numbers, addresses and other private information.\nSo far, there have been forty five companies approached by the FTC in its “test shopper” operation – also known as a privacy practice transparency sweet by the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, or GPEN. Of those, ten have been found out of compliance – that’s almost 25 percent, which is alarming at best and likely criminal too. How many more of these test shopping efforts will occur hasn’t been made public.\nGlobal Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN)\nThis agency, which is obviously in many other countries, works with various law enforcement agencies in countries as well as lawmakers and other government agencies so that cross cooperation may be promoted when it comes to privacy laws. The U.S. isn’t the only one ramping up the heat. Several country members are already taking their own precautions so that their respective national laws are being adhered to.\nThe Ten Out of Compliance\nWondering who received the FTC letter? We have not only the names of the data brokers, but the way they violated the Act as well.\nConsumerBase and one unnamed broker are being accused of prescreening consumers and then using those names to sell to third parties so that “firm” offers of credit can be made, including offers for credit cards and other revolving debt.\nBrokers Data and US Data Corporation both appear to have offered consumer information to insurance companies so that offers can be forwarded to those consumers.\nCrimcheck.com, 4Nannies, US Information Search, People Search Now and Case Breakers were approached and they too offered up various identifying packets of information for employment purposes – which is especially troubling and suggests some companies are willing to approach those who are out of work and desperate for a job with promises of a new career, only if they’ll shell out so much money in “fees” and “headhunter fees”.\nIt’s important to note, too, that these are not being touted as official letters, but rather, reminders of what the FCRA calls for. There are no formal charges pending at this time, though that could change if these problems are addressed in the very near future. The goal, reads the FTC’s presser, is to “remind the companies to evaluate their practices to determine whether they are consumer reporting agencies. If they are, then they must determine how to comply with that law.”\nWhile these brokers are being motivated by greed, the real question is if any of these sells resulted in problems for consumers. Also, the question has to be asked: will consumers file lawsuits when this goes mainstream (and it will)? One thing’s for sure – the government won’t be sued. Late last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the government couldn’t be sued for violating the FCRA. It all happened when an attorney, after paying federal court filing fees for a case, looked at his receipt and realized it had personal information that shouldn’t be on a receipt. He sued and Justice Scalia wrote that the government couldn’t be sued over the Act, because the Act itself has remedies and\n(w)here…a statute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme, we look only to that statute to determine whether Congress intended to subject the United States to damages liability.\nThe case was sent back to a lower court, where it is today.\nSo what are your thoughts? Do you think this investigation is going far enough or has the government tied its own hands when it comes to forcing compliance? Let us know what you think – we want to hear from you."}
{"text": "Passing gas is a normal occurrence associated with gas production in the lower bowels. Sometimes though the gas can be excessive and pose a problem to a person in which case it is referred to as flatulence. It is often an embarrassing and amusing condition and is a common problem in the elderly. However, flatulence may affect any person at any time in life. In the elderly though it may be a bit more difficult to control leading to awkward social experiences. However, it should not be ignored entirely because excessive gas can sometimes be a symptom of other problems in the body.\nNormal Gas in the Bowels\nThe proper term for gas passed through the bottom is flatus. The bowels, mainly the colon, is teeming with bacteria. These normal bowel bacteria are important for producing certain types of nutrients and for it to absorb into the body. It feeds on the waste material in the bowels and is passed out in large numbers during a bowel movement.\nHowever, these bacteria also make large quantities of gas. Sometimes this gas may also come from the chemical processes within the bowels and even from swallowing air, although this is usually passed out with a belch. Flatus is known to have an offensive odor and may cause loud sounds as it erupts from the bowels.\nExcessive Gas (Flatulence)\nA person normally passes gas between 10 to 20 times a day. Often this is not even noticed. About 1,000 to 2,000 milliliters (2 to 4 pints) of gas is produced in the bowels daily. Almost all of this will be passed out within a 24 hour period. Sometimes it is retained a little longer especially in a person who is constipated. The reason why flatus sometimes becomes excessive though is not always known and is at times just a perception.\nFlatulence is more likely to occur with certain bowel disorders like the stomach flu. In these cases it is short term. However, persistent flatulence may need to be investigated medically. It is known that any slowdown of the movement of food and wastes through the gut can increase the chance of excessive gas production. Furthermore any digestive problems where food is not properly digested may also be an underlying cause. Sometimes long term infections and microbe overgrowth in the bowels can also cause flatulence.\nDiseases that cause flatulence\nWith age, the digestion often changes and an intolerance to certain types of food can develop. These irritant foods may cause flatulence, apart from those foods that are known to be naturally ‘gassy’. It may not be that the food is an irritant as is the case that gut may be unable to digest or tolerate the presence of specific substances within the foods. This digestive problem can be due to diseases of organs like the pancreas when the enzymes from the gland is either deficient or absent altogether. This is known as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.\nAnother problem that is more frequently seen with aging is that the movement through the gut is slowed down. Longer periods of time in the bowel can mean that food and wastes are likely to ferment more than normal. This slowness may be seen with certain type of medication widely used for common problems in the senior years like high blood pressure. The slowness may also occur as a complication of diabetes where the nerves controlling the gut muscles becomes weak. Sometimes, however, it can be due to an obstruction in the bowel either with a twisting of the intestines or even masses like polyps or tumors.\nFlatulence may also be seen with constipation. This is very common in the elderly as the gut slows down and the bowel muscles weaken thereby making it difficult to have a bowel movement. The exact cause of most cases of constipation remain unknown although high fiber diets and exercise may help to relieve it. Sometimes with age there is a weakening of the bowel wall leading to small pouches which can become infected and irritated. This is known as diverticulitis and may also cause flatulence.\nWith age, the ability to control the bowel function decreases particularly with certain diseases. Passing gas loudly and at inappropriate times may therefore be difficult to control. If it is excessive, however, it needs to be treated medically. First the cause needs to be diagnosed and then the appropriate treatment commenced. However, many cases of flatulence occurs for no known reason. The key to treatment in unknown cases is to avoid foods that are may increase flatulence, worsen constipation or cause bloating. Live culture yogurt may help to keep the bowel bacteria in check. Gentle exercise like a walk after the meal helps with digestion. In most cases though, it is difficult to limit persistent flatulence in the elderly without treating the root cause if it can be identified.\nLast Updated: December 16th, 2011 by Chris"}
{"text": "BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota's robust economy has led to a record population, the lowest unemployment rate in the nation and thousands of more jobs than takers. But the state's economic miracle led by its oil boom also has resulted in plenty of problems, including more crime and increasingly overcrowded prison and jail cells.\nA state commission made up of lawmakers, judges, lawyers and law enforcement officials is seeking to balance public safety and free-up lockup space by considering alternative sentencing for low-level offenders.\nSen. Ron Carlisle of Bismarck heads the 18-member commission. He says the group is studying such things as enhanced treatment and rehabilitation programs.\nCarlisle says several Republican-led states are finding that alternatives to incarceration are less expensive and more effective than building new lockups."}
{"text": "Our last Tweakipedia entry was one of our most popular yet, where we pitted the budget AMD FX-8350 processor against the likes of Intel's Core i7-4770K and Core i7-4930K on both the LGA 1150 platform, and the high-end enthusiast LGA 2011 platform.\nWell, after this article went out, I had a few people ask me to update my AMD hardware - but I didn't have anything lying around at the time (apart from the hardware used in the test). I reached out to my friends at GIGABYTE and AMD who were more than happy to provide some swanky new hardware to put to work.\nIt wasn't long ago that we tested our two Intel systems at 4K, comparing the LGA 2011 and LGA 1150 sockets against each other, but now we're going to do it all over again, but this time we're going to compare AMD against Intel's two sockets, at 4K.\nDuring the first article, we found out that the CPU didn't matter too much, even when it came to gaming at 4K, but does it matter by taking things down a notch and testing it with an AMD setup? Let's take a look, shall we? First, we'll provide you with all of the specifications of our test beds, so you know what we're comparing.\nWelcome to Part 2 of our new BitFenix Prodigy M build guide, if you're just coming into this now - you can go and check out Part 1, which was an Introduction of what we're planning to do with this slick new PC.\nNow, onto the good stuff - we have a slew of videos showing off the inside of the Prodigy M, giving you a few tricks on how to build your PC inside of this case.\nIn the above video, we take a look at and around the BitFenix Prodigy M. We took out some of the fans and other parts of the case, something we give you an explanation of in the clip.\nThis has been a long time coming, but the final parts have arrived for our new BitFenix Prodigy M build. We're going to do this build in a multi-part series, which will better show off the system itself, and our building and testing of it. What better way to show off our new system, than taking a video of it through Google Glass? Here is our new system #throughglass.\nThe new system will be used in a variety of ways, with different benchmarks being run on it. We'll be doing some testing at 4K, and triple 1440p, too. We're hoping to get some more 4K displays, so that we can do some triple 4K, or 12K testing - that's when the fun will really begin.\nWe've tested our glorious setup on both LGA 1150 and LGA 2011 setups, where we've thrown SAPPHIRE Radeon R9 290X Tri-X GPUs in CrossFire through the high-resolution hoop at 4K. The same test was run on our LGA 1150, something you can check up on here.\nBefore we get into it, lets give you a rundown of the systems we're using here today.\nLGA 1150 specs:\nThe last time we let the legs stretch on our SAPPHIRE Radeon R9 290X Tri-X GPUs in CrossFire was when we tested them at 4K. Well, that was when we had our old LGA 1150 setup, but now we have a flashy new, super high-end LGA 2011 setup and we're going to run them through their paces, again.\nThe system in question has been provided by many of our closest partners in SanDisk, SAPPHIRE, Corsair, InWin and ASUS. Without them, this couldn't of been possible. The specs:\nI have been a busy, busy man in the last couple of months - my wife and I have just had a second, healthy baby girl, on top of the whirlwind of a two-year-old daughter we have now, and I've been busy reorganizing and building a new Tweakipedia test bed, on top of my daily news duties and everything else I do around the site, Facebook page, etc.\nNow that I have some spare time, I'd like to introduce you to our new test bed here at Tweakipedia. We had some help from some of our closest friends, where without them, this would not be at all possible. The old test bed can be checked out here, but the new test bed is quite the beast.\nAnd for good measure, we all know technology upgrades at an increasingly faster rate, so I will tease you that this test bed is only good until around June or so, where it will be upgraded yet again with an even more bleeding-edge set of components.\nStarting with the heart and soul of the new Tweakipedia test bed, we have an Intel Core i7 4930K CPU - this is something I personally purchased, it's not a cherry-picked CPU at all as I wanted an off-the-shelf CPU versus something that scales better than consumer CPUs.\nA couple of days ago we did a preview piece on AMD's Mantle technology, using our trusty Haswell-based system, and Star Swarm as our benchmark. Well, our system has been changed around a little - well, a lot - a fresh installation of Windows performed, and an updated version of Star Swarm.\nThis is why we used the word \"Preview\" in our article - right there on the headline. AMD's Mantle technology is a constantly-evolving piece of technology, that heavily relies on the software (games) side of things for it to work well.\nAn update of Star Swarm was pushed out between us writing the original piece, and now - so now we're up to date, and back with a better system - and an AMD system - to test it with.\nBitcoin mining is big business these days, with people able to 'mine' a digital currency in their own homes. Before Bitcoin had its big take off, mining Bitcoin at home was actually lucrative - if you mined your coins, kept them, and sold them at their peak.\nThese days, 24 hours of mining will net you 0.00001 coins, which is just cents per day. Keeping in mind that it costs you per day to run your machine, so electricity costs have to be thrown into the mix, too. We're not going to go into that right away, but what we are going to do is skim over it a little, and give you our thoughts on a few weeks of mining digital coins - an experience I'll never forget.\nI'm not one that usually can't get something working on my PC, so it annoyed me that I couldn't get Bitcoins mined on my PC right away. I started off trying to use GUIMiner, but in the end it just wouldn't work for me, so I swapped it out for the Java-based BitMinter, which worked first shot.\nWe've already tested our SAPPHIRE Radeon R9 290X Tri-X GPUs in Crossfire, with some truly insane power consumption numbers thanks to there being virtually no limit on overclocking, voltage, or power consumption. We saw 1050W of total draw for our Hawaii-based dual-GPU setup, but what about NVIDIA's GPUs?\nI only have a couple of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780s here in my office, so I decided to throw them on my test bed and see what power consumption numbers are against our R9 290X GPUs in CF. The results, are very surprising to say the least."}
{"text": "Guest Author - Elizabeth Stuttard\n. Even though the skills needed for distance learning are basically the same as those needed for in class learning, there are a few skills that are especially important for distance learners. If you are interested in distance learning but donít have all of these skills, do not give up on distance learning. You can learn these skills. Just make sure that you begin to develop the skills now. Donít wait until you start a course. Here are five skills that are vital for distance learners.\nThis is one of the most important skills required. That is because most distance education is offered using online courses and other courses use some combination of other methods along with online work. Basic computer skills, such as turning a computer on and off, saving files, and using word processing programs are an absolute necessity. Other computer skills necessary for online learning are: knowing how to use e-mail, how to attach files to the e-mail, use your printer, how to participate in chats, listen to audio and sometimes video presentations, how to log onto your course, how to download information, how to allow a website through your firewall and how to use the internet.\nUsually you are learning from home or work and have many more distractions than would occur in a classroom. Therefore you need to be able to organize your time so that you have the least number of distractions and yet do allow enough time to work on the course(s) that you are studying. You need to know what the expectations of the course are such as when assignments are due, how often you must participate in discussions, when tests and exams are scheduled, and when readings are expected to be done. Then you need to schedule your time so that all the work and preparation for those activities are spread out over the whole term rather than trying to catch up all at once or missing a deadline for an assignment.\nIt is necessary to plan your work space and how you will use that space. You need to plan what tools, such as notebooks, pens, folders etc. you will need, and have them readily accessible to that work area. Using those computer skills to file information efficiently and learning how to quickly access the components of your course will make your work easier.\nThe two most important of these skills for distance learning are reading and writing. Reading is essential for the course notes, the discussion boards, the textbook(s), e-mail communications from teachers and other students, and for your online and library research. The writing skills will be used for communicating on the discussion boards, for e-mails you send to students and instructors, and for most assignments.\nThe skill of recognizing your own strengths and weaknesses is essential. If you are lacking some of the above skills, but are willing to learn them, then you will be able to use distance learning to your advantage. However, if you know you are unable to manage time well because you are a procrastinator or if you know you will hate to do so much work at a computer or you like talking but you hate writing, perhaps you should consider attending a bricks and mortar institution to match your strengths rather than attempting to change your weaknesses. Learning computer skills is possible but changing the way that you like to do your learning is much more difficult if not impossible.\nSo, if you have all of the above skills, choose your school and your course and sign up. If you need to brush up on some of those skills, then start working on them now and while working on them, choose your school and course and sign up. Remember we are all constantly learning."}

{"text": "On this coming Sunday June 30, intrepid horologists from around the world will daringly attempt to hold back the relentless onslaught of time. Well, to be fair it won't actually be that difficult. July 1st is scheduled to start an entire second later than it should, a feat of temporal distortion that will be accomplished by making the final minute of the month last 61 seconds.\nAnd should you feel put out by this, you can take it up with the Earth and its wobbly spin.\n2012 features a leap second — that ever so important added slice of time that compensates for inconsistencies in the Earth's rotation. It takes our planet just over 86,400 seconds to make its 360-degree rotation. But because the Earth is affected by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, along with the rolling of the tides, our planet's rotation is slightly slowed down.\nThese rotational mis-steps cause the Earth to get out of synch with International Atomic Time (IAT), which uses the pulsation of atoms to measure time to an accuracy of several billionths of a second. In order to resynchronize solar time with IAT time, the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is adjusted every few years to give us the odd 86,401 second day.\nNow, while this might seem like much ado about nothing, a recent article by Laurent Banguet in Cosmos Magazine noted that it's not without controversy:\nThe leap second has long caused debate among member countries of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), with some arguing for it to be abolished in favour of the exclusive use of atomic time.\nEvery time a second is added, the world's computers need to be manually adjusted, a costly practice that also boosts the risk of error.\nHigh-precision systems such as satellites and some data networks will have to factor in the leap second or risk provoking a calculation catastrophe.\nIt's for this reason, notes Banguet, that rocket launches are never scheduled for leap-second dates.\nThis will be the 25th intervention, with the last three leap seconds happening in 2008, 2005, and 1998.

{"text": "How Using 'Interests' Can Help Build Connection to Understanding and to Developing Skills\nAs autistic individuals we find it heaps easier to connect to understanding when the topic, sentence, concept or idea you are wanting us to appreciate can be related in some way to areas of our interest or attention. You can read more on the science behind this by visiting two of the academic articles I have published: Link 1 and Link 2.\nWhen we can connect what is being taught to us via an area of interest it switches our 'connecting to the big picture brain bits' on (not that our brain is ever switched off) so, enabling us a better chance at building some understanding.\nWhen I talk or teach about this, I'm defining 'interest' as anything that occupies attention. This isn't necessarily a 'special interest' so much as it is either an ongoing occupancy (not good at switching it off, or not wanting to, or not aware of how to) of attention. This can mean attention is being taken over by desire, pain, love, hate, interruption, routine, hobby, fear and so on. So, when I talk about using interest to connect us with how we learn I mean using what our attention is focused upon. This might mean utilising Disney characters in a social story, using Pokemon to illustrate an emotion or putting a recipe together to explain the ingredients for friendship. But, it does not mean finding that 'special interest' that all autistics are supposed to have... not my meaning at all. Some of us do have definite passions but others do not. Observing and noting what it is we seem fixated on, overtaken by or not able to let go off, this could be the very means to helping build connections to learning and understanding in practical ways that help us get through our day.\nI'm putting some examples below to help you see what I mean.\nWhen I was studying at High School (as a mature age student in 1990-91) for my Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) one of our topic areas for Australian History was 'The 1930's'. To help me build motivation and focus upon this topic I needed to find an anchor. I was struggling with identity at the time and consumed by this, plus I had a passion for piston engines (it's now superseded by my passion for birds) so I decided to study and write about 'Women, cross dressing and the 1930's'. If you are asking yourself what 'cross dressing & engines have in common' well, the answer is 'female pilots'. Once I had the connection I could explore the 1930's via Australian female pilots of the time. It was not only their usage of male attire for flying though, it opened doors to connections with all manner of life during the 1930's, including legal options for women, social expectations, fashion, education, employment, the economic climate and so much more!\n'...to incorporate learning to interests... The boys in my class relished reading articles pertaining to their interests, finding spelling words within and writing about what they had learned from the article...' writes Jacquie.\nThen there's using a child's favorite cartoon characters: \"Instead of watching Thomas the Tank Engine as a reward, for instance, we would have the child enter the social setting, with Thomas and Percy and the other characters,\" and learn through them about eye contact, joint play and friendship.\nFrom some more research: Researchers discovered that focusing on these assets allows adolescents to be as capable as anyone else of forging strong friendships. In addition, the research findings demonstrate that the area of the brain that controls such social behavior is not as damaged in AS adolescents as was previously believed. Researchers have reported their findings in the Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions.\n\"The problem is that their restricted interests can dominate their lives and further push away people they'd like to get to know,\" said Robert Koegel, Ph.D., director of the Koegel Autism Center and the study's lead author. \"They're so highly focused on that interest, people think they're weird. But by involving themselves in an activity around the interest, they not only make friends but also become valued members of the group. Their specialized skill becomes a strength.\"\nIn the study, the research team took a creative approach to helping three AS boys to interact with their peers. Rather than discourage their sometimes-obsessive interests, the researchers helped set up social clubs around them and invited students who were not AS to join. The clubs provided a venue for the AS students to display their special interests and abilities, and helped them engage with their peers in a more meaningful way.\nKoegel offered the example of an AS student who has a keen interest in computer graphics. The team created a graphic design club in which students would design logos for various companies and businesses.Because most of the students lacked the necessary expertise, they depended on their AS classmate to make the venture a success. \"When he was able to interact on a topic in which he was interested, he was able to demonstrate more normal social behavior,\" Koegel said. \"He not only made friends with his fellow members, he was elected club president.\" See: Article Link\nThen there is the situation of a young woman who has Down syndrome and autism using her love of Ninja Turtles and shredding, to start her own business with the support of her Mum: Metro Article and Video. Emma has her own 'work shirt' which has 'Master Shredder' written on the back. Emma has incorporated her love of Ninja Turtles movies and characters into and alongside of her love for shredding.\nSo, social understanding, good self-esteem, confidence and ability can all be built upon and improved as we make connections to understanding. Understanding is constructed as we make connections from things we already feel and get. Connections are more likely to spread in autism as others join us at our point of interest. It might be around a computer, playing video games, creating models from Lego, playing with numbers, maps, engaging in conversation, watching TV or a video, reading a book or taking part in role play. Whatever it is, it comes together better, if we are already attending.\nThe above are just a few examples of connection via motivational interest. There are lots and lots of ways we can use, even the seemingly negative aspects of perceived interest, to build connections. Please feel free to email me if you have an interesting story to tell about connections from being interested in one thing which led to establishing concepts with something else."}

{"text": "Closing Remarks by Angel Gurría\nParis, Monday 20 November 2017\n(As prepared for delivery)\nCommissioner Moedas, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThank you for inviting me to close the first day of this conference on Innovation in Government: The New Normal. I am delighted that the OECD is partnering with the European Commission in this area. A warm welcome to the European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, Mr. Carlos Moedas.\nWhat a necessary discussion: improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our public sectors! Of course we need to make them more inclusive, more green, more dynamic, more innovative. This is crucial to deliver the recovery and tackle climate change but also to win back our lost treasure: the trust of our people.\nWe can go nowhere if people don’t trust governments. Yet trust is rock-bottom. In the OECD, only 4 out of 10 citizens trust their governments. In some countries like Greece, Japan, France, Australia, Canada, Spain and the UK, around seven-in-ten people say today’s children will be worse off than the current generation.\nWith rising inequalities and anxieties around technology, automation and globalisation, more than ever governments have to show people that the public sector can improve their lives and the lives of their children. More than ever, governments have to show that they are moving with the times, embracing new ways of thinking and new technologies to impact the everyday lives of people.\nDespite this, most government innovation agendas are built on loosely defined concepts and inconsistent implementation methodologies. Most do not include innovation when they train and appoint civil servants and almost half have no dedicated funding for innovation.\nBut there has been progress as highlighted in in the OECD’s latest publication “Fostering Public Sector Innovation”. Since the last innovation conference in 2014, a number of governments have created innovation divisions, labs, and even ministries, such as Denmark’s Ministry of Public Sector Innovation.\nKorea is exploring new channels of citizen engagement with its “People Transition Office”, established by President Moon Jae-in to collect ideas from citizens to shape the country’s national agenda.\nCanada’s “Free Agents” and “TalentCloud” programmes are transforming the public workforce model by building a pool of talented, interdisciplinary experts who can be deployed on-demand to work on priority projects.\nOn this side of the Atlantic, the United Kingdom is harnessing new technologies to improve policy design and evaluation through its “Predictiv” programme. This web-based platform enables policymakers to test whether new policies work with an online population before they are deployed in the real world.\nWe applaud these and other initiatives that are challenging the status quo. The OECD is here to help build a global community and knowledge base to support and disseminate innovations like these.\nThat’s what the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is all about! The OPSI provides a place for sharing, discussing and co-creating solutions that work.\nThe OECD offers many tools to help policymakers promote greater public sector innovation. A couple of examples include the OECD Recommendation on Digital Government Strategies, which helps to bring government closer to citizens by using digital technologies to improve accountability, inclusiveness, policy coherence, and regulation. The OURData Index on Open Government Data is another valuable OECD resource which assesses governments’ efforts to implement open data in the three critical areas - Openness, Usefulness and Re-usability of government data.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nOne of the leading innovators of our times, Bill Gates, once said: “Never before in history has innovation offered promise of so much, to so many, in so short a time.” The public sector has a vital role to play in harnessing innovation to deliver on this promise.\nToday’s discussion revealed the strength of our commitment, the scope of our vision and the richness of our tools. These will allow us to move from pockets of success to system-wide transformation, designing, delivering and implementing better public sector innovation for better lives. Together we can make innovation in government the new normal.\nI wish you another fruitful day tomorrow and I look forward to hearing the results. Thank you."}
{"text": "Back in April, I attended my first ever MOOC. What is a MOOC you ask? A Massively Open Online Course, for a great introduction check out this video. I found the course to be useful, but also frustrating. It lacked a little in design – or at least that was my thought at the time, now that I know a little more about MOOCs, I'm starting to \"get it\".\nI'm planning to take another MOOC – eduMOOC. This one is on the topic of \"Online Learning Today…and Tomorrow\". At seeing the introductory page, my immediate impression is that a lot more thought has gone into the design of this one.\nThat being said, one thing I'm finding lacking in these MOOCs is advice for those that are new to MOOC and those that are new to learning online. You see, I did my Masters online, so I have experience with online community. I have a sense of what is necessary to contribute to the community and to foster conversations that will help my learning and the learning of my fellow participants.\nSo as an experienced online learner and not so experienced MOOCer, I figured I'd offer a few tips for getting the most out of a MOOC:\n- You don't have to read everything. Especially in the first couple of weeks, there will be 100s if not 1000s of posts to the google group. I receive a daily digest and scan it. If there is an interesting conversation, I then go onto google groups and join in.\n- Join a conversation. If you find a conversation interesting and you have something to add – a person perspective or insight, whatever – join in. You never know if your insight will help spark an insight in someone else. It is these sparks together that keep the community alight!\n- Start a conversation. Do you have a burning question? Ask it. Chances are you aren't the only one with the question. Did you have an ah-ha moment when you read something? Share it! Chances are your ah-ha moment may inspire an ah-ha moment in someone else.\n- Ask questions that promote responses from different perspectives. MOOCs bring together people with a wide range of experiences and interests – asking questions that promote sharing of diverse perspectives provides value for both you and the other participants in the course.\nTechnically the course starts next week, June 30, but already people have started to introduce themselves. If you haven't tried out a MOOC before, I encourage you to do so. You can sign up directly on the information page here. It is free, so why not?\nIf you are an experience MOOCer reading this and you have some tips to share, please leave a comment."}
{"text": "Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to add some digital information on an image. Or else we can say that AR is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated perceptual information.\nVirtual reality (VR) is a completely computer-generated scenario that simulates a realistic experience. In simple words, it is an artificial, computer-generated simulation/recreation of a real-life environment. VR generates realistic images and sounds that put you in the middle of a spectacular imaginary world. AR adds virtual stuff to the real-world environment. The differences between the two are listed in the table on this page.\nQ. What are the largest advancements in Nanotechnology for IC design?\nProf. Ashish Mulajkar\nAns. Nanotechnology allows integrated circuits (ICs) or chips to be made on nanometre scale. Semiconductors are witnessing a very fast technological progress, and so is nanotechnology in IC designs.\nThe technology node, or simply node, refers to a specific semiconductor manufacturing process and its design rules. Smaller node generally means the smaller feature size, and smaller, faster and more power-efficient transistors. Recent technology nodes such as 16nm and 14nm are already being used in foundries. Going a step further, the smallest commercial chips now use 10nm technology.\nNanotechnology is still evolving but some of its most promising innovations include nano-based manufacturing of devices and nanoparticles that have potential applications in military, battery technology and replacement of traditional electronics devices. You can find many products that rely on nanomaterials and processes. Some examples are given below:\n1. Nanomaterials-based flexible, foldable, rollable and stretchable electronic products are being integrated into a variety of products for wearables, consumer electronics, medical, aerospace and the Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n2. IBM scientists have created a 3D map of the earth that is so small that its 1000 copies could fit on one grain of salt. This is accomplished through a new technique that uses a tiny silicon tip to create patterns and structures as small as 15 nanometres.\n3. Transistors are getting smaller and smaller in sizes through advancements in nanotechnology.\n4. Nanoscale chip design enables future IoTs. The latest nanoscale chip requires so little energy in wireless signal transmission that it will rarely need battery replacement.\n5. A nanoscale field-effect transistor (FET) has been fabricated with carbon nanotubes. This FET has demonstrated an excellent performance of a low-voltage drive operation even at as small as 100nm of channel length.\n6. In automotive products, nanomaterials are used for high-power rechargeable battery systems, thermoelectric materials for temperature control, high-efficiency/low-cost sensors and electronics, thin-film solar panels and much more.\n7. Textile manufacturers have begun to use nanomaterials in washable, durable smart fabrics equipped with flexible sensors and electronics for health monitoring, solar energy capture, and energy harvesting through movement."}
{"text": "Cluttered user interfaces are like rain on a car windscreen, obscuring the most crucial information. As part of the drive to improve this issue, User Experience (UX) has replaced the term User Interface (UI) to describe visualisation methods which support users in decision-making with efficient and effective visual information.\nThe result is a better-informed user who can make decisions faster and more accurately.\nThere are countless historical examples of overloading operators with information, resulting in uninformed decisions with catastrophic results. Ineffective control panel graphics, which did not provide overviews of critical systems, partly caused the fire and explosion at Texaco Milford Haven. Additionally, the site’s alarm systems were ill-equipped to deal with an emergency and displayed excessive alerts, which negatively impacted the operators’ ability to respond. The issues created by a cluttered control panel compounded mechanical failures at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant in the USA, to disastrous effect.\nRecently, a set of standards and guidelines have sought to improve the presentation of information to operators. The end goal of the EEMUA standards is to reduce the likelihood of cascading events and catastrophic consequences with UI best practices.\nThere was a tendency to pack more and more data and information on each screen as operator interfaces, SCADA, and HMI became more potent through the 80s, 90s and early 00s. Screens would be animated and awash with counter-intuitive colours, resulting in an overload of information thanks to a flood of real-time data presented in intricate diagrams. Complex navigation hierarchies presented in this manner meant separating critical information from noise more challenging.\nYet there is good news. Modern UX design now follows a trend towards more uncomplicated operator displays. Reduced clutter, intuitive navigation, unsaturated colours and optimised alarm management can be easily implemented to improve existing UIs.\nMigrating can often be an iterative process that tackles the most inefficient and cluttered displays, intending to impose structure and order on what can otherwise be unintuitive. To understand whether your system might benefit from a modern approach to visualisation, the following can be considered:\n- Does your system have many standing alarms that have been present for some time with no resolution?\n- Do your user interfaces seek to mimic process and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs)?\n- Do you need more than a single click to get important information?\n- Do you or your operators ever deal with more than six alarms per hour from their control systems?\nIf your answer to any of these questions is yes, you may benefit from reviewing your control system visualisation strategy. Astec has implemented numerous systems in line with the latest standards and guidelines.\nThe result of making such simple changes is vastly improved operator efficiency. A reduced workload and vastly improved availability of information mean faster response times. In turn, powered by better data to drive accurate decision making, the root cause of issues is also better understood, ensuring rapid and lasting resolutions to operational issues."}
{"text": "7 Tips & Tricks Farmers Use to Feed Their Animals (& Actually Keep Them Healthy)\nIn recent years, Americans have become increasingly concerned about where their meat comes from, how it is raised, and how the animals are treated by farmers. Films like Food, Inc. have made many Americans think more carefully about the food they choose to feed their families. Parents are concerned about everything from antibiotics in chicken to hormones in beef to tainted animal feed linked to Mad Cow. But many Americans don’t realize that many farmers actually treat their animals very well. Think about it: if a farmer doesn’t take care of his livestock, he loses money. So it’s only natural that smart farmers choose to treat their herds and flocks to the best possible food. Here are some of the ways that farmers preserve the health of their animals...just by feeding them properly.\n1. Natural Enzymes for Water Quality\nResearch into a natural enzyme that can be added to hog and chicken feed could make many animals around the country much healthier and happier. The feed contains a natural enzyme made from fungi. When added to livestock feed, the enzyme helps to reduce phosphates lost in manure. The end result? The animals retain more phosphates, making them healthier. In addition, water quality is also improved because the manure created by the livestock does not contain phosphates that can contaminate the water supply.\n2. Grass-fed Beef\nThe findings from a recent USDA-conducted study comparing corn-fed beef and grass-fed beef found that grass-fed beef is \"higher in beta-carotene, vitamin E, omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), calcium, magnesium, and potassium; lower in inflammatory omega-6s; and lower in saturated fats that have been linked to heart disease.\"\n3. Halal-Certified Meats\nHalal is the Muslim equivalent to Kosher food preparation in the Jewish faith, and these animals are treated quite well before they are taken off to the abattoir. Halal-certified animals (cattle, goats, sheep, and poultry) cannot be given artificial growth hormones during the course of their lives. In addition, the animals and poultry must have been fed only vegetarian feed, organic feed or Amish-style feed.\n4. Kobe Beef\nKobe beef comes from the most pampered cows in the world. While it is true that the cows are raised to have a high degree of fat marbling, the cows lead remarkably stress-free lives. The cows are massaged daily with rice wine in order to promote circulation and improve the quality of the meat. The cows are also given beer every day to help them relax, as well as to help improve their appetites. Today they are raised on only 262 small farms, most of which pasture fewer than five cows, and the largest of which run only 10 to 15 animals. Happy cows make for great-tasting meat, and Japanese Kobe beef often retails for $100 per pound.\n5. Prebiotics and Probiotics\nPrebiotics and Probiotics are another way that farmers and ranchers can improve the health of their animals. In the case of horses, prebiotics and probiotics are used to help aid digestion, which in turn can ease the ill effects of stress, illness, and even old age in a beloved horse. By feeding an animal the correct balance of live and active cultures from beneficial bacteria, the owners are protecting their investment and improving the animal's quality of life.\n6. Whole Grain Chicken Feed\nSome farmers are passionate about feeding their flocks with the highest quality, all-natural feed. One chicken farmer swears by this feed recipe (http://www.greenerpasturesfarm.com/ChickenFeedRecipe.html) 2 parts whole corn (in winter this is increased to 3 or 4 parts) 3 parts soft white wheat 3 parts hard red winter wheat 1 part hulled barley 1 part oat groats 1 part sunflower seeds (in winter this is increased to 2 parts) 1 part millet 1 part kamut 1 part amaranth seeds 1 part split peas 1 part lentils 1 part quinoa 1 part sesame seeds 1/2 part flax seeds 1/2 part kelp granules free choice of granite grit free choice of oyster shell Those are some healthy chickens! Most Americans don’t even eat that well! Oh, and in case you are wondering about the grit and shells....those are necessary for proper digestion. The minerals in oyster shells also help the chickens to lay eggs with strong shells.\n7. Swine Dining\nPigs are notorious for eating anything they can get ahold of. But some pigs eat better than others. For example, one select group of pigs is fed by some of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas. Nevada farmer Bob Combs (who was featured on the TV program “Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe”) takes leftover food from renowned Vegas eateries and gives it to his pigs. The finest seafood, pastries, and even ice cream help to fatten his hogs. What Las Vegas diners would pay hundreds of dollars for in a restaurant becomes the favored feed of our porcine friends, giving them a rich and varied diet.\nSources: http://www.greenenvironmentnews.com/Environment/Agriculture/Fungal+Enzyme+Could+Help+Livestock+Retain+Phosphate http://www.albalagh.net/halal/0059.shtml http://www.grayson-jockeyclub.org/newsimages/Probiotics050109.pdf http://planetgreen.discovery.com/food-health/foods-unsafe-doctors-eat.html http://www.askthemeatman.com/kobe_beef.htm"}

Each of its three cylinders run a longer the fuel intake stroke than a regular petrol engine has - an approach engineers call the 'Miller Cycle'. The supercharger compresses the air fed into the engine to counter the loss of air back up the pipe that would otherwise result from holding the intake valve open for longer.\nThe upshot of all this is a much higher compression ratio which, in turn, ups the engine's combustion efficiency, resulting in that low CO2 output figure.\nNissan said the DIG-S engine produces 72kW (96.6 horsepower) and 142Nm of torque. That, the company claimed, gives the 1.2-litre engine the same power output as a conventional 1.5-litre four-cylinder job.\nReplace the manual gearbox with a CVT, and the CO2 output goes up from 95g/km to 115g/km, taking the road tax from zero to £30.\nGetting 95g/km will depend on your driving style, but that's fortunately not yet a consideration for VED calculations.\nThe Micra DIG-S is expected in 2012. ®"}

{"text": "National Puerto Rican Parade: Famed sesame street actress speaks on education\nMay 24, 2012 · Print This Article\nThe National Puerto Rican Day Parade, Inc. has announced that Ohio, “The Buckeye State”, has been granted the State Dedication for the17thAnnual National Puerto Rican Day Parade (55thAnnual Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York since the event’s inception as a local organization). Each year the parade organizers have honorees marching in the parade and HispanicOhio.com was able to speak to author/actress Sonia Manzano (New York Godmother), also known as “Maria” from Sesame Street who is one of the honorees.\nManzano’s first professional acting job was in Godspell in 1969; two years later she began her amazing career as “Maria” on Sesame Street. Aside from acting along muppets and teaching pre-school children their A, B, Cs, Manzano has made appearances on TNT’s Law and Order and The Food Network’s Dinner: Impossible.\nIt was clear Manzano has a passion to teach young children. Aside from Sesame Street she has published the children’s book, A Box Full of Kittens”, and due out in September is her first adult book, The Revolution of Evelyn Serrano.\nManzano says the book is about “a girl’s social consciousness awakening”; the book is set in Spanish Harlem, 1969. Like Sesame Street, her books are a way to teach youth about a world constantly changing.\nManzano agrees the age of learning has reached the point where “a person who learns with a pen and paper is at a disadvantage to someone who is learning on a computer,” adding that “people who learn on computers learn differently than those who don’t.”\nAccording to childrensdatabank.org, Hispanics are the least likely to have home internet access compared to Whites, Blacks, and the general public, creating an inherent disadvantage to the new age learning process. Childrensdatabank.org also says younger children are the most influenced by technology, which is why Manzano believes education at a young age is so important.\n“Early education is probably the most important place to improve because it’s hard to catch up when you’re 14,” she said.\nEducation from kindergarten to grade 12 has been scrutinized by both parents and lawmakers alike. Manzano says the United States government always looks toward education when funding cuts are made.\n“When they cut funds, education goes first,” she said. “Education in America is sort of taking a backseat to everything else and you can’t watch the news without someone saying Latino’s are falling behind.”\nAs for the parade, Manzano says it is a great honor to be a part of something bigger than oneself, she said over the years it has become more than just a parade, it’s a celebration of culture.\n“I used to come every year when I was a child as a spectator, she said. “It would be wonderful if we would all be united and work together to participate in the fruits (of our country).”"}
{"text": "A best-selling text rich in case studies that reflects on the unique complexities of marriage, couples, and family counseling.\nDeveloped for students, educators, supervisors, and practitioners alike, this text examines the significant classical and contemporary issues in marriage and family therapy. The text opens with a thoughtful discussion of client and therapist worldviews, value sensitive care, the ecology of therapy, and commonalities between personal and professional acculturation. Following the book’s preliminary discussion, the text moves on to consider the legal, ethical, and professional issues that marriage and family therapists face each day as well as the best strategies for navigating these issues.\nThe new fifth edition includes a number of new topics, including multicultural issues reflecting institutional oppression; boundary, competency, and liability concerns associated with technology-based client care; the significance of supervision in both skill acquisition and professional acculturation in one’s early career; nontraditional family care; conflicts between legal and ethical obligations; emerging issues in MFT licensure; and ethical and empirical considerations related to evidence-based care.\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\nThe Second Edition, updated to incorporate the latest AAMFT Code of Ethics, offers a wealth of updated coverage, all geared to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy standards. There are numerous new case studies, and new discussions of the differences between MFT as a distinct profession and MFT as a professional subspecialty. In addition, a completely new chapter explores contemporary ethical issues for which no formal precedent has yet been established. With its practical focus and planned, concise coverage, the book ensures students to gain both a theoretical background and an applications orientation. In each of the three major sections, chapters address \"general\" issues, as well as issues specific to marriage and family therapy. A concluding chapter in each section offers case illustrations that expand upon the material covered in the previous chapter. This two-step presentation helps students attain a greater understanding of how information is used in actual practice...and helps them more effectively internalize instruction.From the Inside Flap:\nAlthough less than 100 years old, professional psychotherapy has become a major influence in society. Therapists contribute to and considerably affect many aspects of modern life. During this time, psychotherapy has broadened its perspective. No longer is it practiced exclusively on a one-therapist-to-one-client basis. Group therapy efforts have become commonplace in almost every mental health setting. Likewise, the last several decades have seen the advent of another expansion within the psychotherapeutic field, that of marriage and family therapy.\nMany therapists have replaced or supplemented their traditional individual and group models of practice with one emphasizing couples and families as the dominant treatment focus. This is not to suggest that contact with marital partners and other family members had been completely ignored. Rather, marital partners and family members had always been considered in light of the individual client's concerns and from an individually oriented therapeutic perspective.\nAs the practice of marriage and family therapy has evolved, training procedures have become more explicit, replicable, and accessible. Specific theories and techniques have been identified. Broad curricular components for training have been compiled. And specific content, goals, and teaching methods for university coursework and professional workshops have been delineated. These materials and strategies all continue to be researched, evaluated, and enhanced. Noticeably lacking before the publication of the first edition of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy, however, were sources addressing \"nontherapy\" issues necessary to supplement the therapeutic training of marriage and family therapists (Piercy & Sprenkle, 1983).\nThe importance of these nontherapy issues was emphasized in an article entitled \"Family Therapy May Be Dangerous for Your Health\" (Hare-Mustin, 1980), in which the author states:\nIn sum, family therapy may not be in the best interests of individual family members.\nFamily therapists and their clients need to be aware of possible risks to the rights of\nthe individual member. By being required to participate, individuals may have to\nsubordinate their own goals and give up limited confidentiality and privacy. In addition,\ntherapists who idealize the traditional family may foster stereotyped roles and expectations\nin the family that disadvantage individuals and limit their well-being and mental health. (p. 938)\nAlthough offerings in the professional literature and training opportunities at conferences and workshops have increased in both number and quality, nontherapy issues—particularly ethical, legal, and associated professional concerns—are still underrepresented in relation to their potential impact on the practice of many mental health professionals. The simple fact that marriage and family therapy differs from individual and group therapy on both conceptual and pragmatic levels requires that therapists be adequately prepared to handle controversial issues from a marriage and family perspective as well. Questions that are difficult in individual and group therapy can become significantly more complicated when a couple or whole family presents itself for services (Margolin, 1982).\nThe American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, the professional organization with which most marriage and family therapists are primarily affiliated, specifies graduate-level coursework in \"professional studies\" as a requirement within its educational requirements for clinical membership. In response, courses in \"ethical, legal, and professional issues\" have been developed and constitute a core component of marriage and family training programs. The first and second editions of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy served as a basic text for these courses as well as a primary source for practicing professionals seeking to expand their knowledge of ethical, legal, and professional issues in marriage and family therapy. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT\nThis third edition has been updated and expanded so that it may continue to serve as a basic resource for both beginning students and practicing professionals. It is divided into three parts. Part 1 addresses ethical issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 1 examines major ethical issues confronting all therapists, particularly the beginning marriage and family therapist and the experienced practitioner who is shifting from an individual approach to a marriage and family perspective. Chapter 2 discusses ethical issues inherent in the interactive nature of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 3 presents contemporary ethical issues for which there is little precedent; positions advocated in the professional literature and recommendations made for handling these issues are reviewed. Chapter 4 offers a \"casebook\" of examples with critiques highlighting the AAMFT Code of Ethics (American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 1998). Part 2 considers legal issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 5 investigates the roles and relationships of marriage and family therapists within the legal system. Chapter 6 examines relevant family law. Chapter 7, like Chapter 4, is a casebook of examples with critiques discussing the impact of legal issues on marriage and family therapy. Part 3 focuses on professional issues. Chapter 8 discusses \"valuing\" and the professional practice of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 9 explores the professional identity of a marriage and family therapist. Chapter 10 offers another casebook of examples addressing professional questions.\nSpecial attention should be paid to the three casebook chapters: 4, 7, and 10. We recall our days as clinicians-in-training seeking to fathom those notions we garnered from our readings. Classroom instructors and clinical supervisors, knowledgeable and skilled from years of experience, provided case examples to illustrate the concepts more clearly. Those illustrations made learning a more concrete experience, from which we emerged much better prepared.\nOverall, this book seeks to encourage a greater familiarization and expansion of knowledge relevant to ethical, legal, and professional issues necessary to supplement clinical training and practice in marriage and family therapy We hope that you will gain an introduction to some of the issues you may encounter and that you will be stimulated to think about your own position as a marriage and family therapist, whether as a primary source of professional identity or professional specialization. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSo many persons have contributed, both directly and indirectly, to our personal and professional development and to the writing of this book that it is impossible to thank them all. We thank the majority of them as a group by offering this book as a contribution of social interest that will, we hope, enhance the lives of mental health professionals and the clients with whom they interact. A few individuals, however, need to be singled out for special thanks.\nLee Baruth coauthored the first edition of this book. Without his many contributions, this work would not have been possible. For their constructive suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript, we thank reviewers Robert Barrett, University of North Carolina-Charlotte; Sarah G. Gabbay, Colorado State University; Lizbeth Ann Gray, Oregon State University; and Michael Poison, East Carolina University. We are particularly indebted to Kevin Davis, the executive editor for this project at Merrill/Prentice Hall.\nFinally, we thank those who have made personal contributions to our lives. From Sam Gladding: \"I am indebted to my parents, Russell and Gertrude, for their attention to teaching me the importance of values at a young age. My wife, Claire, and our children, Ben, Nate, and Tim, have been both understanding and supportive during my times of writing for this book. A family's encouragement and company cannot be valued enough.\" From Ted Remley: \"I want to thank my parents, TE and Era, for giving me the education necessary to write books. I also appreciate my extended family, close friends, colleagues, and graduate students for tolerating my absences when I write and my crabby disposition when I am trying to make deadlines.\" And from Charles Huber: \"I thank my parents, Charles and Helen, for modeling for me those core ethical qualities I had only to label, not learn, when I began my professional training and later entered clinical practice. My partner, Betsy, and our children, David and Morgan, have been most patient during the writing of the revision.\"\nSamuel T Gladding, Ph. D.\nTheodore E Remley, Jr., Ph.D.\nCharles H.

{"text": "The Force Matures\nJust as the standing of the military usually increases in wartime, so did the stature of the nation's police rise in reaction to the domestic upheavals of the late 1960s and early 1970s. When \"law and order\" -- disdained for a time in some circles as a code for repression -- became a precious commodity, those charged with maintaining it were given more of the resources necessary to do so. Increased personnel, training, equipment, and public support tended to translate into higher morale, better performance, and greater capacity to meet the challenges of crime and disorder that rended American society during the Vietnam era.\nNo organization exemplified this trend better than the Park Police. The force expanded from 417 officers in 1971 to 570 officers in 1977, with a proportionate increase in support personnel. Jerry L. Wells, who succeeded Grant Wright as chief in 1973 and served capably until 1979, commanded a complex organization, which was outlined in a published report on the status of the force in 1975. \nThe heart of the force was the Operations Division, led by Deputy Chief Parker T. Hill. It then consisted of approximately 410 uniformed officers, 32 plainclothes officers, 54 guards, 18 civilians, and seven visitor and traffic aides. They were divided among five branches: Patrol, Criminal Investigations, Special Operations, the New York Field Office, and the San Francisco Field Office.\nThe Patrol Branch, under Inspector Denny R. Sorah, employed 232 officers, 43 guards, seven aides, and six civilians in five substations in and around Washington. The Central Substation, commanded. by Lt. Richard J. Cusick, was by far the largest with 99 officers and was responsible for patrolling the capital's monumental core. The Baltimore-Washington Parkway Substation, located in Greenbelt Park, Maryland, dated from the assignment of 11 men to police that road in 1953. (The National Park Service accepted jurisdiction over the parkway with reluctance and sought for years to transfer it to Maryland.) Thirty officers under Lt. Lloyd E. Hill patrolled this major north-south artery and adjacent federal properties in 1975.\nThe Anacostia Substation, opened in 1970, had 36 officers under Lt. Thomas J. McDonnell responsible for Anacostia Park, the Suitland Parkway, Fort Washington Park, and other parklands in eastern Washington and nearby Maryland. Although the parks they served were old Park Police responsibilities, the current Rock Creek Park and George Washington Memorial Parkway substations opened in 1971. Lt. Richard E. Magee commanded the 29 officers assigned to the Rock Creek Park Substation, with jurisdiction over numerous park areas in Northeast and Northwest Washington in addition to Rock Creek Park. Lt. W. Franklin Stevens had 39 officers under him at the George Washington Memorial Parkway Substation, located at Glen Echo Park, Maryland. They covered the parkway on both sides of the river, Wolf Trap Farm Park, Arlington National Cemetery, and the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park as far as Seneca, Maryland.\nThe Criminal Investigations Branch, under Inspector Roy E. Coign, included 31 investigators and seven uniformed officers in the Identification Section. Branch personnel searched for and collected evidence in some 2,500 criminal cases during 1975. Photography and fingerprinting were part of their responsibilities. With other elements of the force, they regularly assisted the U.S. Secret Service in providing security for the president, vice president, and visiting heads of state. \nThe Special Operations Force, commanded by Inspector James C. Lindsey, comprised 97 officers employing motorcycles, horses, helicopters, dogs, and other means of dealing with specialized situations. The Horse Mounted Unit dated from the mid-1930s. After the war John D. Rockefeller, Jr., donated Morgan horses from his estate at Pocantico Hills, New York, and by 1953 the unit encompassed 10 mounted police, used primarily in Rock Greek Park.  In 1975 the Horse Mounted Unit had 35 officers under Lt. Robert O. Harrison. In addition to regular patrols, they were called upon for demonstrations, parades, exhibitions, and special events at Minute Man National Historical Park near Boston and Fort McHenry National Monument in Baltimore. Sgt. Denis R. Ayres was honored for his many contributions to the mounted program ten years later with the Department of the Interior's Distinguished Service Award and the special rank of sergeant major.\nIn 1950 a Civilian Disturbance Group equipped with helmets, shotguns, and tear gas equipment had been formed for riot control, and a 30-foot trailer had been outfitted as a mobile field headquarters after a mid-air crash at National Airport showed the force ill-equipped to respond to protracted emergencies.  From such modest beginnings rose the sophisticated special equipment and tactics teams and Selective Enforcement Unit of the Special Operations Force. When the \"People's Bicentennial Commission\" massed 100,000 protesters to disrupt President Gerald R. Ford's appearance at Minute Man National Historical Park on April 19, 1975, the Selective Enforcement Unit helped provide security. Other notable demonstrations at which Special Operations units functioned during the decade included those by Iranians in 1978 and Arab students protesting the treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979, both in Lafayette Park, and the American Agricultural Movement's month-long occupation of the Mall in 1979. Of course, major demonstrations entailed commitments from all elements of the force.\nWhen the Canine Unit was established in 1957, the Park Police became the first police department in the Washington area to use service dogs. During 1975 the unit provided explosives detection assistance at Washington National Airport and the Smithsonian Institution and aided the Bermuda Police in connection with Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Bermuda. The unit also participated in more than 50 school and community exhibitions.\nThe Aviation Section was formed in April 1973 under the command of Lt. Richard T. Chittick to provide aerial observation, photography, and rescue services throughout the metropolitan area. Initially it consisted of one Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter, \"Eagle One,\" costing $175,000 and manned by three pilots and three rescue technicians -- all Park Police officers. In 1975 a second 206B, \"Eagle Two,\" was added at a cost of $225,000, requiring three more pilots. At that time the section moved from its original base at the Anacostia Naval Station to Andrews Air Force Base while awaiting the completion of its permanent facility, \"Eagles Nest,\" at Anacostia Park in May 1976.\nDuring 1975 the section recorded more than 1,100 hours of flight time. Its missions included 14 river rescues, 17 searches for felons, and 28 air evacuations from traffic accidents. In 1979 two additional crews allowed the section to expand its service from 16 to 24 hours, and Eagle One was replaced by a Bell 206L-1 Long Ranger helicopter with a larger engine and stretched fuselage costing $460,000. The rescue technicians were upgraded to intermediate paramedics by the Washington Hospital Center's MEDSTAR facility in 1982, and in 1983 Eagle Two was replaced by a Bell 206L-3 Long Ranger with a still-larger engine costing $700,000. \nThe section's most publicized mission came during a snowstorm on the afternoon of January 13, 1982, when Air Florida Flight 90 struck one of the 14th Street bridges after its takeoff from National Airport and plunged into the Potomac. At considerable personal risk, pilot Donald W. Usher and paramedic Melvin E. Windsor hovered low over the river in Eagle One and pulled five survivors to safety. The pair received the Interior Department's Valor Award from Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt in a special ceremony soon afterward.\nIn 1972 Congress gave the National Park Service two more major urban responsibilities: Gateway National Recreation Area in New York City and Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. In February 1974 they became what are still the only national park system units outside the Service's National Capital Region with permanent Park Police contingents. \nInspector Hugh Groves was the first commander of the New York Field Office at Gateway, followed in 1975 by Inspector James P. Deely. Forty five officers and 10 guards were assigned there in 1975. The office began the first Park Police boat patrol, which in 1977 had four boats (a Mako, a Boston Whaler, and two Grovers) and handled more than 800 incidents ranging from rescues to larcenies. The office also added four horse mounted patrol officers in 1977. \nThe San Francisco Field Office, under Inspector Lynn H. Herring, expanded from 29 officers in 1975 to 44 in 1977, including five horse mounted officers. In addition to its regular duties at Golden Gate, the unit was positioned to respond to special law enforcement needs at other national parklands in the West. In 1975, for example, it augmented Special Operations Force personnel from Washington in handling demonstrations at Death Valley National Monument and Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\nMore highly educated recruits and more intensive training after recruitment contributed heavily to the greater professionalism of the Park Police during the 1970s and 80s. In 1972 training for all federal law enforcement personnel (except FBI agents and military police) was consolidated at the Treasury Department's Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, located originally on L Street in Washington and relocated to the former Glynco Naval Station at Brunswick, Georgia, in 1975. FLETC provided a 12-week basic training program covering such topics as due process in interrogation, scientific aids to investigation, ethics, self-defense, and skilled vehicle operation. Much of the curriculum came from the former Park Police training program at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia. Park Police graduates then advanced to five weeks of specialized training emphasizing local and park laws and regulations. Ultimately they became partners of field training officers for nine weeks of on-the-job training. Capt. Charles R. Stebbins, head of the force's Training Branch in 1975, was stationed at FLETC to coordinate Park Police training and instruction there.\nSome park rangers had attended the Park Police training program at Jones Point, and many more were sent to FLETC. Although the need for greater law enforcement capability was clear in many parks, the conversion of generalist rangers to parapolicemen became controversial. Some thought the trend to law enforcement specialization went too far and deplored what they saw as an erosion of the traditional ranger image. \"I firmly believe that in some parks the law enforcement speciality has gotten out of balance with other responsibilities of park rangers,\" NPS Director Gary Everhardt declared in 1976, even as legislation was en route to enactment that would require all park employees exercising law enforcement duties to be specially trained and certified.  Others felt that rangers who had only been through FLETC and did not constantly do police work were unlikely to be sufficiently trained and mentally prepared to handle difficult police situations.  The law enforcement training of rangers also tended to revive the old question about the need for a separate park police force. Anticipating this question from Congress, a 1983 budget briefing paper stated that rangers were still generalists insufficiently skilled in urban law enforcement to deal with situations handled by the Park Police. \nThe force of the 70s and 80s was not only better educated and trained but more representative of the society it served. Blacks were a rarity in the Park Police in 1947 when Grant Wright came aboard. By 1949 12 of its 114 officers were black, but Wright and three black colleagues had to pursue a grievance to gain cruiser patrol assignments and be considered for promotion. A year later Wright became a motorcycle officer, and in 1954 he was made the first black corporal.  Rising through the ranks to progressively more responsible positions, Wright became chief of the force in 1968. Other blacks followed to high rank, among them Parker T. Hill, who succeeded Jerry Wells as chief in 1979 and led the force until Lynn Herring took over in 1981.\nThe first park policewoman was Beatrice Ball, who joined the force on January 1, 1942, after 10 years with the Metropolitan Police. She soon enlisted in the Navy's WAVES, however, and was replaced by Lydia H. Barton that summer. The novelty of Barton's appointment was played up in a January 1943 press account: \"Fifteen stalwart members of the Park Police were startled yesterday by the appearance of Mrs. Lydia H. Barton, park police woman, at the first session of the Park Police Training School\" (founded three years earlier). Both women were restricted to cases involving women and juveniles. \nIn 1954 there were five women on the force. One was Pvt. Grace H. Judy, a 10-year veteran with a college degree who had formerly taught high school. Among her duties, as featured in a newspaper article, were plain clothes assignments at the scenes of molestation complaints carrying a revolver, blackjack, and claw in her handbag. \nBy the mid-70s women as well as blacks were in the Park Police main stream. Chief Wells ordered aggressive affirmative action in recruiting, and the minority and female composition of FLETC classes ran as high as 40 percent.  In 1974 Kathleen Carlson achieved the highest scholastic score -- 971 points out of a possible 1,000 -- of any basic trainee at FLETC to that time.\nJane P. Marshall was typical of the modern policewomen who performed the same duties as their male counterparts. On May 21, 1975, she came to the aid of Officer Ronald L. Blankenship, who had been shot. Jumping from her cruiser, she was struck by two bullets. While bleeding profusely she transmitted a call for help, reported the means of the assailant's escape, and assisted in directing the landing of the force's medivac helicopter. (The assailant and his accomplice were later apprehended, convicted, and imprisoned.) Officer Marshall's courage and cool performance under fire was in the best police tradition. \nThe attack on Blankenship and Marshall brought the force almost as much publicity as an incident involving quite a different woman the previous year. At 2 a.m. on October 7, 1974, Pvts. Thomas R. Johann and Larry W. Brent observed a Lincoln Continental speeding through West Potomac Park without lights and halted it at the Kutz Bridge over the Tidal Basin. Its intoxicated occupants included Rep. Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Annabell Battistella, an Argentinian go-go dancer who had performed at the Silver Slipper night club on 13th Street as Fanne Foxe, \"the Argentine firecracker.\" While Mills threatened Johann's job, Battistella ran from the car and jumped into the water, from which she was pulled struggling by Brent.  The comic-opera episode and ensuing scandal inspired \"The Ballad of Fanne Foxe\" (\"She was only a stripper at the Silver Slipper, but she had her ways and means . . .\") and doomed Mills's congressional career.\nWith its base of operations in the nation's capital, the U.S. Park Police would inevitably become involved in such highly visible and sensitive situations. Fortunately, by this time the force had risen far above its original status and overcome the internal turmoil that had earlier hampered its effectiveness. No longer dismissed as second-rate, its survival assured, it commanded near-universal respect as a credit to the police profession and the National Park Service."}
{"text": "OK, so here goes on a lengthy post for the admins amongst us on NSD Analysis.Â An area I feel I know quite well …. however as you’ll remember from my last post this is based on publicly available information.\nNSD (or Notes System Diagnostic) is the name given to software bundled in Domino to give a snapshot of what the Domino system is doing.Â The tool produces text files with enormous ammounts of information and can be run manually or will run automatically during a crash.Â Interested ? …… (it may seem a bit dull but the information here could save you a lot of time!).\nWithout memory nothing works.Â In the operating system memory is divided into Kernel and User Address Space.Â The Kernel looks after the OS, hardware drivers and communications with the hardware.Â The User Address Space is where our applications run, and this includes Domino.\nSo when Domino crashes it happens in the User Address Space ….. this means that Domino won’t directly cause a blue screen of death!!!!Â However Domino may, for example,Â be attempting to read or write to an area of disk which could cause a kernel memory error remembering that the kernel must deal with the disk.\nAs we know, Domino is made up of a number of individual processes (nserver, nreplica, nrouter etc).Â Each of these processes all do their own little bit to make up the server.Â Each process is doing a number of tasks at any one time, these are called threads.Â And within each thread there is a specific set of individual actions.Â These are called function calls.\nCrashes (in a paragraph!)\nYeah, Yeah, Blah, Blah so what does this mean for me?Â Well Domino is a fairly complex beast.Â Now and again a thread will try and use some memory which is reserved or in use by another process.Â This is a memory exception and at this point everything will go a bit messy.Â A panic will be recorded in the thread, Domino will freeze everything that it is doing and the nsd task will run.Â This will gain a snapshot of the environment immediately before the crash storing the important results in dataibm_technical_support on either the client or server which has crashed.\nHangs are a different beast and I’ll not do much here to go into them.Â To recognise a hang the easiest way to look for the hang is to examine in real time the memory allocated to each Domino or Notes process.Â Remember from earlier each process is made up of a number of threads.Â New threads are constantly starting and old threads are constantly stopping.Â So for each process you should see the memory allocated to that process changing with time.Â If you don’t see changes in the memory allocated to a thread then you possibly have a hang.Â A server can recover from a hang.Â A hung process may or may not prevent user sessions onÂ a server.Â To troubleshoot a hang you need to run the nsd process 3 times at 5 minute intervals and then engage IBM Support to help resolve the issue.Â\nRunning NSD Manually\nThe important thing to remember when running NSD is that by default it will kill all the processes ….. so if you want to run it without killing the PIDs check out the extensions by running nsd -?.Â Normally advice is to run nsd -detach as that leaves the processes alone after running.\nWell the file produced will always have a common naming convention:\nEach platform has its own format and for sake of making this post a record length I’m going to stick to Wintel.\nSections inÂ Wintel NSD’s\nFirst section is the header with system information, a list of each Domino instance and a list of the processes running therein.Â You’ll see some strange entries for Found X processes, matched Y.Â If Y is one less than X then providing you are running Domino as a Windows service don’t worry!Â nsd examines all processes from nserver down, nservice is the parent of nserver.Â nsd sees nservice is running but also sees it isn’t running under nserver so it says for example found 22 matched 21.\nNext we have the process table.Â From here you can see all processes on the server.Â Processes nsd recognises as Domino are indicated with “->”.Â The position of “[” denotes parent and child status – indents denoting children.Â You’ll see nsd as a child of whichever process crashed.\nOK so this section helps gather a picture of what was running on the server\nBelow this section there is a dump of each process, what files the process was using, and then importantly a dump of each thread.Â On the thread which resulted in the crash the name will change from thread to “fatal thread”.Â Best option once you have looked through the process table is to search for “FATAL”.\nSo once you’ve searched for fatal you may see something like this:\n### FATAL THREAD 39/83 [ nSERVER:07c0: 2764]\n### FP=0743f548, PC=60197cf3, SP=0743ebd0, stksize=2424\nException code: c0000005 (ACCESS_VIOLATION)\n@[ 1] 0x60197cf3 nnotes._Panic@4+483 (7430016,496dae76,0,496dace8)\n@[ 2]

{"text": "heating effect of electric current\nBest Results From Wikipedia Yahoo Answers Encyclopedia Youtube\nEddy currents (also called Foucault currents) are currents induced in conductors, opposing the change in flux that generated them. It is caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause a circulating flow of electrons, or a current, within the body of the conductor. These circulating eddies of current create induced magnetic fields that oppose the change of the original magnetic field due to Lenz's law, causing repulsive or drag forces between the conductor and the magnet. The stronger the applied magnetic field, or the greater the electrical conductivity of the conductor, or the faster the field that the conductor is exposed to changes, then the greater the currents that are developed and the greater the opposing field.\nEddy currents, like all electric currents, generate heat as well as electromagnetic forces. The heat can be harnessed for induction heating. The electromagnetic forces can be used for levitation, creating movement, or to give a strong braking effect. Eddy currents can also have undesirable effects, for instance power loss in transformers. In this application, they are minimised with thin plates, by lamination of conductors or other details of conductor shape.\nSelf-induced eddy currents are responsible for the skin effect in conductors. The latter can be used for non-destructive testing of materials for geometry features, like micro-cracks. A similar effect is the proximity effect, which is caused by externally-induced eddy currents.\nThe first person to observe current eddies was FranÃ§ois Arago (1786-1853), the 25th president of France, who was also a mathematician, physicist and astronomer. In 1824 he observed what has been called rotatory magnetism, and the fact that most conductive bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Michael Faraday (1791-1867).\nIn 1834, Heinrich Lenz stated Lenz's law, which says that the direction of induced current flow in an object will be such that its magnetic field will oppose the magnetic field that caused the current flow. Eddy currents develop secondary flux that cancels a part of the external flux.\nFrench physicist LÃ©on Foucault (1819-1868) is credited with having discovered Eddy currents. In September, 1855, he discovered that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the eddy current induced in the metal. The first use of eddy current for Non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when D. E. Hughes used the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests.\nWhen a conductor moves relative to the field generated by a source, electromotive forces (EMFs) can be generated around loops within the conductor. These EMFs acting on the resistivity of the material generate a current around the loop, in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. These currents dissipate energy, and create a magnetic field that tends to oppose the changes in the field.\nEddy currents are created when a conductor experiences changes in the magnetic field. If either the conductor is moving through a steady magnetic field, or the magnetic field is changing around a stationary conductor, eddy currents will occur in the conductor. Both effects are present when a conductor moves through a varying magnetic field, as is the case at the top and bottom edges of the magnetized region shown in the diagram. Eddy currents will be generated wherever a conducting object experiences a change in the intensity or direction of the magnetic field at any point within it, and not just at the boundaries.\nThe swirling current set up in the conductor is due to electrons experiencing a Lorentz force that is perpendicular to their motion. Hence, they veer to their right, or left, depending on the direction of the applied field and whether the strength of the field is increasing or declining. The resistivity of the conductor acts to damp the amplitude of the eddy currents, as well as straighten their paths. Lenz's law encapsulates the fact that the current swirls in such a way as to create an induced magnetic field that opposes the phenomenon that created it. In the case of a varying applied field, the induced field will always be in the opposite direction to that applied. The same will be true when a varying external field is increasing in strength. However, when a varying field is falling in strength, the induced field will be in the same direction as that originally applied, in order to oppose the decline.\nAn object or part of an object experiences steady field intensity and direction where there is still relative motion of the field and the object (for example in the center of the field in the diagram), or unsteady fields where the currents cannot circulate due to the geometry of the conductor. In these situations charges collect on or within the object and these charges then produce static electric potentials that oppose any further current. Currents may be initially associated with the creation of static potentials, but these may be transitory and small.\nEddy currents generate resistive losses that transform some forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule heating reduces efficiency of iron-core transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing magnetic fields. Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting\nIn physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is a material which contains movable electric charges. In metallic conductors, such as copper or aluminum, the movable charged particles are electrons (see electrical conduction). Positive charges may also be mobile in the form of atoms in a lattice that are missing electrons (known as holes), or in the form of ions, such as in the electrolyte of a battery. Insulators are non-conducting materials with fewer mobile charges, which resist the flow of electric current.\nAll conductors contain electric charges which will move when an electric potential difference (measured in volts) is applied across separate points on the material. This flow of charge (measured in amperes) is what is meant by electric current. In most materials, the direct current is proportional to the voltage (as determined by Ohm's law), provided the temperature remains constant and the material remains in the same shape and state.\nMost familiar conductors are metallic. Copper is the most common material used for electrical wiring. Silver is the best conductor, but is expensive. Because it does not corrode, gold is used for high-quality surface-to-surface contacts. However, there are also many non-metallic conductors, including graphite, solutions of salts, and all plasmas. There are even conductive polymers. See electrical conduction for more information on the physical mechanism for charge flow in materials.\nAll non-superconducting materials offer some resistance and warm up when a current flows. Thus, proper design of an electrical conductor takes into account the temperature that the conductor needs to be able to endure without damage, as well as the quantity of electric current. The motion of charges also creates an electromagnetic field around the conductor that exerts a mechanical radial squeezing force on the conductor. A conductor of a given material and volume (length Ã— cross-sectional area) has no real limit to the current it can carry without being destroyed as long as the heat generated by the resistive loss is removed and the conductor can withstand the radial forces. This effect is especially critical in printed circuits, where conductors are relatively small and close together, and inside an enclosure: the heat produced, if not properly removed, can cause fusing (melting) of the tracks.\nThermal and electrical conductivity often go together. For instance, most metals are both electrical and thermal conductors. However, some materials are practical electrical conductors without being good thermal conductors.\nIn many countries, conductors are measured by their cross section in square millimeters. However, in the United States, conductors are measured by American wire gauge for smaller ones, and circular mils for larger ones.\nOf the metals commonly used for conductors, copper has a high conductivity. Silver is more conductive, but due to cost it is not practical in most cases. However, it is used in specialized equipment, such as satellites, and as a thin plating to mitigate skin effect losses at high frequencies. Because of its ease of connection by soldering or clamping, copper is still the most common choice for most light-gauge wires.\nAluminium has been used as a conductor in housing applications for cost reasons. It is actually more conductive than copper when compared by unit weight, but it has technical problems that have led to problems when used for household and similar wiring, sometimes having led to structural fires:\n- a tendency to form an electrically resistive surface oxide within connections, leading to heat cycling of the connection (unless protected by a well-maintained protective paste);\n- a tendency to \"creep\" under thermal cycling, causing connections to get looser due to a low mechanical yield point of the aluminium; and\n- a coefficient of thermal expansion sufficiently different from the materials used for connections, accelerating the creep problem and addressed by using only plugs, switches, and splices rated specifically for aluminium.\nThese problems do not affect other uses, and aluminium is commonly used for the low voltage \"drop\" between a power pole and the household meter. It is also the most common metal used in high-voltage transmission lines, in combination with steel as structural reinforcement.\nThe surface of anodized aluminium does not conduct electricity, and sometimes this must be considered when aluminium enclosures are to be electrically bonded for safety or to enclose or exclude electromagnetic radiation.\nThe ampacity of a conductor, that is, the amount of current it can carry, is related to its electrical resistance: a lower-resistance conductor can carry more current. The resistance, in turn, is determined by the material the conductor is made from (as described above) and the conductor's size. For a given material, conductors with a larger cross-sectional area have less resistance than conductors with a smaller cross-sectional area.\nElectric shock occurs upon contact of a (human) body with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles or hair. Typically, the expression is used to denote an unwanted exposure to electricity, hence the effects are considered undesirable. The minimum current a human can feel is thought to be about 1 milliampere (mA) that's .001A, but this is highly dependent on the frequency of the signal. The current may cause tissue damage or fibrillation if it is sufficiently high. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Generally, currents approaching 100 mA are lethal if they pass through sensitive portions of the body.\nIf the voltage is less than 200 V, then the human skin, more precisely the stratum corneum, is the main contributor to the impedance of the body in the case of a macroshock— the passing of current between two contact points on the skin. The characteristics of the skin are non-linear however. If the voltage is above 450â€“600 V, then dielectric breakdown of the skin occurs.\nIf an electrical circuit is established by electrodes introduced in the body, bypassing the skin, then the potential for lethality is much higher if a circuit though the heart is established. This is known as a microshock. Currents of only 10 ÂµA can be sufficient to cause fibrillation in this case. This is a concern in modern hospital settings when the patient is connected to multiple devices.\nSigns and symptoms\nHeating due to resistance can cause extensive and deep burns. Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy (which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance) available from the source. Damage due to current is through tissue heating. It is a relatively unknown fact that more electrical workers die from burns than from an electric shock, in fact only around 20% die from the effects of shock.\nA domestic power supply voltage (110 or 230 V), 50 or 60 Hz AC current through the chest for a fraction of a second may induce ventricular fibrillation at currents as low as 60 mA. With DC, 300 to 500 mA is required. If the current has a direct pathway to the heart (e.g., via a cardiac catheter or other kind of electrode), a much lower current of less than 1 mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation. If not immediately treated by defibrillation, fibrillations are usually lethal because all the heart muscle cells move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood to maintain circulation. Above 200 mA, muscle contractions are so strong that the heart muscles cannot move at all.\nCurrent can cause interference with nervous control, especially over the heart and lungs. Repeated or severe electric shock which does not lead to death has been shown to cause neuropathy. Recent research has found that functional differences in neural activation during spatial working memory and implicit learning oculomotor tasks have been identified in electrical shock victims.\nWhen the current path is through the head, it appears that, with sufficient current, loss of consciousness almost always occurs swiftly. (This is borne out by some limited self-experimentation by early designers of the electric chair and by research from the field of animal husbandry, where electric stunning has been extensively studied.)\nOne major corporation found that up to 80 percent of its electrical injuries involve thermal burns due to arcing faults. The arc flash in an electrical fault produces the same type of light radiation from which electric welders protect themselves using face shields with dark glass, heavy leather gloves, and full-coverage clothing. The heat produced may cause severe burns, especially on unprotected flesh. The blast produced by vaporizing metallic components can break bones and irreparably damage internal organs. The degree of hazard present at a particular location can be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrical system, and appropriate protection worn if the electrical work must be performed with the electricity on.\nThe voltage necessary for electrocution depends on the current through the body and the duration of the current. Ohm's law states that the current drawn depends on the resistance of the body. The resistance of human skin varies from person to person and fluctuates between different times of day. The NIOSH states \"Under dry conditions, the resistance offered by the human body may be as high as 100,000 Ohms. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000 Ohms,\" adding that \"high-voltage electrical energy quickly breaks down human skin, reducing the human body's resistance to 500 Ohms.\"\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission gives the following values for the total body impedance of a hand to hand circuit for dry skin, large contact areas, 50 Hz AC currents (the columns contain the distribution of the impedance in the population percentile; for example at 100 V 50% of the population had an impedance of 1875Î© or less):\nPoint of entry\n- Macroshock: Current across intact skin and through the body. Current from arm to arm, or between an arm and a foot, is likely to traverse the heart, therefore it is much more dangerous than current between a leg and the ground. This type of shock by definition must pass into the body through the skin.\n- Microshock: Very small, current source with a pathway directly connected to the heart tissue. The shock is required to be a\nIn heat transfer, conduction (or heat conduction) is the transfer of thermal energy between regions of matter due to a temperature gradient. Heat always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature, and results in the elimination of temperature differences by establishing thermal equilibrium. Conduction takes place in all forms of matter, viz. solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but does not require any bulk motion of matter. In solids, it is due to the combination of vibrations of the molecules in a lattice or phonons with the energy transported by free electrons. In gases and liquids, conduction is due to the collisions and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.\nOn a microscopic scale, conduction occurs as rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring particles, transferring some of their kinetic energy. Heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Conduction is greater in solids because the network of relatively fixed spacial relationships between atoms helps to transfer energy between them by vibration.\nAs density decreases so does conduction. Therefore, fluids (and especially gases) are less conductive. This is due to the large distance between atoms in a gas: fewer collisions between atoms means less conduction. Conductivity of gases increases with temperature. Conductivity increases with increasing pressure from vacuum up to a critical point that the density of the gas is such that molecules of the gas may be expected to collide with each other before they transfer heat from one surface to another. After this point conductivity increases only slightly with increasing pressure and density.\nThermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. A temperature drop is often observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon is said to be a result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Interfacial thermal resistance is a measure of an interface's resistance to thermal flow. This thermal resistance differs from contact resistance, as it exists even at atomically perfect interfaces. Understanding the thermal resistance at the interface between two materials is of primary significance in the study of its thermal properties. Interfaces often contribute significantly to the observed properties of the materials.\nThe inter-molecular transfer of energy could be primarily by elastic impact as in fluids or by free electron diffusion as in metals or phonon vibration as in insulators. In insulators the heat flux is carried almost entirely by phonon vibrations.\nMetals (e.g. copper, platinum, gold,etc.) are usually the best conductors of thermal energy. This is due to the way that metals are chemically bonded: metallic bonds (as opposed to covalent or ionic bonds) have free-moving electrons which are able to transfer thermal energy rapidly through the metal. The \"electron fluid\" of a conductive metallic solid conducts nearly all of the heat flux through the solid. Phonon flux is still present, but carries less than 1% of the energy. Electrons also conduct electric current through conductive solids, and the thermal and electrical conductivities of most metals have about the same ratio. A good electrical conductor, such as copper, usually also conducts heat well. The Peltier-Seebeck effect exhibits the propensity of electrons to conduct heat through an electrically conductive solid. Thermoelectricity is caused by the relationship between electrons, heat fluxes and electrical currents. Heat conduction within a solid is directly analogous to diffusion of particles within a fluid, in the situation where there are no fluid currents.\nTo quantify the ease with which a particular medium conducts, engineers employ the thermal conductivity, also known as the conductivity constant or conduction coefficient, k. In thermal conductivityk is defined as \"the quantity of heat, Q, transmitted in time (t) through a thickness (L), in a direction normal to a surface of area (A), due to a temperature difference (Î”T) [...].\" Thermal conductivity is a material propertythat is primarily dependent on the medium'sphase, temperature, density, and molecular bonding. Thermal effusivity is a quantity derived from conductivity which is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings.\nSteady state conduction is the form of conduction which happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant so that after an equilibration time, the spatial distribution of temperatures (temperature field) in the conducting object does not change a\nheating means of making a building comfortably warm relative to a colder outside temperature. Old, primitive methods of heating a building or a room within it include the open fire, the fireplace, and the stove . In ancient Rome a heating system, called a hypocaust, warmed a building by passing hot gases from a furnace through enclosed passages under the floors and behind the walls before releasing them outside. The principal modern systems that are used to heat a building are classified as warm air, hot water, steam, or electricity. In the warm-air system air, heated in a furnace, rises through warm-air ducts and enters the rooms through outlets, while cooler air in the rooms passes into return ducts that lead back to the furnace. The air circulates through the system by convection, i.e., the tendency of a fluid such as air to rise when warm and sink when cool. In newer buildings the circulation is assisted by a fan. The hot-water system has a boiler for heating the water that is sent through connecting pipes to radiators and convectors, the latter devices being metal enclosures containing hot-water pipes surrounded by metal fins. The circulation is maintained by pumps or, in older buildings, by convection. In the steam-heating system, steam generated in a boiler is circulated by its own pressure (sometimes aided by a vacuum pump) through radiators. There are many kinds of electric heating systems. In one type current is sent through wires into electric resistors that are contained in convectors in rooms. The resistors convert the current into heat. In a radiant panel heating system a room is warmed by heat emitted from wall, floor, or ceiling panels. They are warmed by the circulation of warm air, hot water, or steam or by an electric current in resistors within or behind the panels. Experiments are being made to utilize solar energy for heating buildings. In many large buildings, such as theaters, public libraries, and municipal buildings, the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning units are combined in one system. In district heating, heat is distributed from a heating plant to buildings in a section (usually commercial) of a city. Bibliography: See F. Porges, Handbook of Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (1982).\nelectric circuit unbroken path along which an electric current exists or is intended or able to flow. A simple circuit might consist of an electric cell (the power source), two conducting wires (one end of each being attached to each terminal of the cell), and a small lamp (the load) to which the free ends of the wires leading from the cell are attached. When the connections are made properly, current flows, the circuit is said to be \"closed,\" and the lamp will light. The current flows from the cell along one wire to the lamp, through the lamp, and along the other wire back to the cell. When the wires are disconnected, the circuit is said to be \"open\" or \"broken.\" In practice, circuits are opened by such devices as switches, fuses, and circuit breakers (see fuse, electric ; circuit breaker ; short circuit ). Two general circuit classifications are series and parallel. The elements of a series circuit are connected end to end; the same current flows through its parts one after another. The elements of a parallel circuit are connected so that each component has the same voltage across its terminals; the current flow is divided among its parts. When two circuit elements are connected in series, their effective resistance ( impedance if the circuit is being fed alternating current) is equal to the sum of the separate resistances; the current is the same in each component throughout the circuit. When circuit elements are connected in parallel, the total resistance is less than that of the element having the least resistance, and the total current is equal to the sum of the currents in the individual branches. A battery-powered circuit is an example of a direct-current circuit; the voltages and currents are constant in magnitude and do not vary with time. In alternating-current circuits, the voltage and current periodically reverse direction with time. A standard electrical outlet supplies alternating current. Lighting circuits and electrical machinery use alternating current circuits. Many other devices, including computers, stereo systems, and television sets, must first convert the alternating current to direct current. That is done by a special internal circuit usually called a power supply. A digital circuit is a special kind of electronic circuit used in computers and many other devices. Magnetic circuits are analogous to electric circuits, where magnetic materials are regarded as conductors of magnetic flux. Magnetic circuits can be part of an electric circuit; a transformer is an example. Equivalent circuits are used in circuit analysis as a modeling tool; a simple circuit made up of a resistor , and an inductor might be used to electrically represent a loudspeaker. Electrical circuits can also be used in other fields of studies. In the study of heat flow, for example, a resistor is used to represent thermal insulation. Operating electric circuits can be used for general problem solving (as in an analog computer ).\nFrom Yahoo Answers\nAnswers:It's the current in a conductor which causes it to heat up. The higher the voltage, the lower the current assuming the power load stays the same. This is why electric distribution cables are at a very high voltage, so the current isn't as high, otherwise the cables would have to be impractically thick and expensive. If the voltage through a circuit is increased, then so is the current (and also the power, measured in Watts), which would cause an increase in heat. So increasing the voltage across your high resistance wire would cause the heat ( power load ) to increase because the current would also be increased.\nAnswers:The most obvious advantages of the heating effect of an electric current is in electric cooking ovens, toasters, electric irons, electric blankets, electric space heaters, hair dryers, curling irons, etc. Electric heating can be the cleanest, safest, and most convenient form of heat energy utilized in a home. Why is heat produced when current is passed through a wire? A metallic conductor has a large number of free electrons in it. When a potential difference is applied across the ends of a metallic wire, the free electrons begin to drift from a region of low potential to a region of high potential. These electrons collide with the positive ions (the atoms which have lost their electrons). In these collisions, the energy of the electron is transferred to the positive ions and they begin to vibrate more violently. As a result, heat is produced. The greater the number of electrons flowing per second, the greater will be the rate of collisions and so greater is the heat produced.\nAnswers:Heat is its specific heat capacity. Electricity is its resistivity But out of the options it is C, conductivity."}

A lot of the time, the inorganic subdivision method is lost on people because they don't understand the kind of influence one vertex or edge has on it's adjacent ones. Hopefully by the end of this tutorial you'll have a real feel for how inorganic modeling works and you'll enjoy the process because it finishes with a toaster. And almost everyone likes toast.\nTo get started, create a box with the settings I've indicated on the right. We'll be starting with a box because, of course, toasters are kind of rectangular and so it makes logical sense to start here. There isn't much to say except that you'll always want to start with whatever the basic shape you're working with. For instance; working on a piston on a robot? Start with a cylinder!\nFor this frame, convert the box into an Editable polygon object by right clicking on it and selecting \"Convert to Editable Poly\". This puts it in a mode that will let you edit it with a very nice toolset. 3DSMax is famous for its Edit Poly tools.\nNext, click on the \"edge\" sub-object mode which will allow you select all the edges along the length of the toaster. These are the longest edges parallel to the way toast would go into the toaster. We'll be grabbing all four edges. Be sure \"Ignore Backfacing\" is unchecked or you may not get the edge on the corner away from you!\nHere I've connected the edges we selected together. I did this by clicking the button that says \"Connect\". You can find it under the \"Edit Edges\" rollout just below Target Weld. It's also outlined in the image to the right. It gives us some extra edges to work with in the box. The \"connect\" tool will be one of the most valuable tools we use in this inorganic sub-d modeling tutorial.\nIn this frame we're using the \"chamfer\" tool (pronounced Cham-fur). This can be found to the left of \"Connect\" which we used above. If you click the word \"chamfer\" you can use the tool in the viewport with your mouse. If you click the small box next to it you can open the dialog window that allows you to enter a value. I've done the latter to show the more exacting readers what values I used."}

{"text": "When it comes to gift-giving, many people use the words “gift” and “present” interchangeably. However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two. This blog post will explore the differences between a gift and a present and how best to use each term when giving thoughtful tokens of appreciation to someone special.\nThe basic difference between Gift & Present\nThe terms “gift” and “present” are often used interchangeably; however, they have distinct meanings. A gift is given freely and without expecting anything in return. It is generally given with kindness, love, appreciation or as a token of good luck, as Sentiments Express is the best online gift delivery in Lahore Pakistan.\nGift-giving is an act of kindness and generosity and should be done without any expectations. Giving someone a gift should come from the heart and be given selflessly, without expecting anything in return. This makes it all the more unique and meaningful to the receiver.\nA present is something that is given with conditions and expectations attached. It is more likely to be given in anticipation of a return favor, to thank someone, or to obtain a favor from someone.\nGifts – A token of love\nA gift is something that is given without expecting anything in return. It is an expression of appreciation or affection and can often come as a surprise. A gift can be anything from a handmade item to something you purchased or even something you created with your hands. Gifts are meant to show the receiver how much they are appreciated, valued, and loved. Gifts can also be tokens of appreciation for a job well done or for being a loyal friend.\nThe best gifts are those that have been given thoughtfully and come from the heart. To send gifts, you can choose Sentiments Express, the online gift delivery in Lahore Pakistan. When giving a gift, it is essential to remember that the thought behind it matters more than the cost.\nA present is given with conditions\nA present is usually given for a specific purpose or to fulfill an obligation. It often has a predetermined recipient, such as a family member, friend, or colleague. A present may also be given to reward someone for a job well done or to show appreciation for their service. The recipient may need to meet certain expectations to receive the gift, such as completing a task, achieving a certain grade, or attending an event.\nThought behind the gifts?\nWhen it comes to gifting, it is essential to pick something that you know the recipient will appreciate. The best gifts are those that show thought and consideration. Consider what the recipient likes and tailor your gift to their interests.\nFor example, if the recipient is an avid reader, consider giving a new book they have yet to read. If they enjoy baking or cooking, consider giving them a cookbook or kitchen gadgets to help them create delicious dishes. A camping or outdoor activity kit may be the perfect fit if they are a lover of the outdoors.\nNo matter the gift you choose, the most important thing is to give something from the heart. The thoughtfulness behind the gift is sure to be appreciated and cherished."}
{"text": "Introduction to Integers.\nOne of my favorite tasks using a small system like our ZX Spectrum is to overcome limitations imposed on integers and floating-point numbers.\nIn ZX Basic, integers have a width of 16 bits (plus sign) allowing you to manipulate numbers between -65.535 and 65.535, and once out of this range, you’re venturing into floating point numbers wilderness.\nIn Forth, unless you can rely on some floating-point library, all math is integer math, and usually Z80 implementations uses 16-bits single-precision integers and 32-bits double-precision integers, so expanding the range to a wider interval of integers that lie between -2.147.483.648 and 2.147.483.647.\nThe lack of floating-point and engineering notation is not so bad because the trade-off is a faster speed and great simplicity, by defining suitable fine-grained unit-of-measure like “millimeters” instead of “thousandth of meter”, for instance.\nOn the other hand, irrational constant numbers, like “Greek-Pi”, that have an infinite number of decimal places, cannot be exactly represented neither using floating-points nor double precision integers, and in Forth, it is very common to exploit irrational constant numbers via Rational Approximation.\nThe concept behind this useful technique is that any irrational number can be represented by a rational approximation. For example, 355/113 is a very good approximation of “pi” with an error of less than one part in a million.\nFor instance, the formula to calculate the circumference of a circle can be coded directly as\n: CIRCUMFERENCE ( n1 -- n2 ) 2* 355 113 */ ;\nin particular, the definition */ is the typical scaling operator that takes a single-precision integer multiplies it by a number (355 in our case) and divides it by another (113 in our case) but ensuring a double-precision intermediate result to avoid loss of precision.\nMy v-Forth implementation provides a definition UM* to multiply two single-precision numbers and get a double-precision number, and a definition UM/MOD to divide a double-precision number and get two single-precision numbers quotient and reminder.\nIt seems there is little way to use some “triple-precision”  integer i.e. 48-bits of precision, but I’ll show how I had the chance to code an improved definition of */ that operates on a double-precision integer passing through a “triple-precision” integer so we can improve our previous version of CIRCUMFERENCE to cope with “double-precision” integer and use a “triple-precision” intermediate result using this new definition M*/\n: CIRCUMFERENCE ( d1 -- d2 ) 2DUP D+ \\ double the radius 355 113 M*/ ;\nHere below, I expose the implementation of such M*/ using the math definitions already available UM* and UM/MOD.\nIn the following definition explanation, each symbol represents a single-precision unsigned integer, that is a number between 0 and 65535, so we can think of it as we were using some “65536-based” math.\n- we can split the double-precision integer d into its two components dH and dL and then multiply them by m separately getting two double-precision integer a and b, we split in aH, aL and bH, bL.\n- we have to add aH part to b obtaining c, we split in cH, cL. This way we now have three single-precision integers cH, cL, aL, that represents our triple-precision intermediate value integer.\n- We can perform one first division, dividing c by n obtaining quotient q1 and reminder r1.\n- We compose r1 and aL that is the double-precision number we now divide by n to obtain quotient q2, while remainder r2 is discarded for our purposes.\n\\ dH dL x \\ m = \\ ---------- \\ aH aL \\ bH bL \\ ---------- \\ cH cL aL : n = q1 q2 \\ r1 aL \\ : M*/ ( d m n -- d2 ) 2dup xor 3 pick xor >R \\ keep track of final sign abs >R abs >R swap R@ UM* rot R> UM* \\ 1. multiply by m and get a and b rot 0 D+ \\ 2. obtain c R@ UM/MOD \\ 3. divide n into c giving quotient and reminder rot rot R> UM/MOD \\ 4. divide n into the composition r1+aL nip swap \\ discard reminder r2 and reorder the two partial-quotients R> D+- \\ determine final sign. ;\n500000. CIRCUMFERENCE D.\nIn conclusion, using just some Arithmetics we overcame the native 32-bit vForth limitation.\n Forth Application Techniques – Elizabeth D.

{"text": "AHMEDABAD: When one hears about Indian culture, one of the first things one would hear would be many of the experiments that have been conducted by modern science have already been described in ancient scriptures. Right from nature of universe and the existence of atoms to metaphysical objects such as soul have fascinated the scientists and enthusiasts alike.\nHowever, as science requires proof, now an organization has decided to turn a number of concepts into experiments. City-based Research Institute of Scientific Secrets from Indian Oriental Scriptures (RISSIOS) has procured land in Mumbai for the purpose and the promoters are hopeful that they would be able to throw new light on the already known subjects by the next year. The institute has been established by Jain Acharya Vijaynandighosh Suri.\nThe institute in collaboration with LD Institute of Indology had organized three-day seminar on 'Modern Physics and Jain Darshan' that concluded on Sunday. Scientists and subject experts along with Acharya discussed subjects such as quantum physics, concepts in Einstein's theories of relativity and existence of soul vis-a-vis Jain philosophy and scriptures.\n\"Along with the studies of Jain scriptures, I also started understanding concepts of science and started comparing the two fields. Both have its own guiding principles but what we want to do is to awaken the citizens to their own rich legacy and heritage. Thus, we started the institute and we have conducted a number of experiments so far with astonishing results,\" said Acharya Suri.\nThe institute has conducted experiments on power of mantra and music, Jain method of testing quality of food and has published papers and books on subjects such as science in Jainism, impact of sound on humans, penance in Jainism and its scientific base and so on.\n\"Many believe that it was the pre- and post-British Raj period where we lost our roots and embraced the new ideas and philosophies. Even today, we take the examples from western world on quintessential subjects like spirituality, concepts of rebirth and Vedic and Jain mathematics. Why can't we study these subjects and come out with original research?\" asked an institute official."}

{"text": "Dr. Gabi Avital, the chief scientist of Israel’s Education Ministry, was fired on Monday after reiterating his position that evolution is just a theory, and that it should be taught alongside creationism as the two most widely held beliefs regarding how our world originated.\nIn an interview with Israel’s Ma’ariv newspaper last month, Avital insisted that “the conditions [for life on earth] were not accidental. [Charles] Darwin was a great scientist, but he took his theory in dangerous directions, and we need to teach the flaws of that theory, too.”\nSpeaking to Israel National News a day after being fired, Avital insisted the education of Israel’s young people is incomplete because it does not take into account the “numerous studies that refute the science of evolution” and show that a human being is not just a “substance without a soul.”\nShortly after being appointed to the post of chief scientist in December 2009, Avital advocated for adding creationism to the school curriculum.\nThe office of Education Minister Gideon Saar (Likud) issued a statement on Monday claiming that Avital had been hired on a trial basis, and that his trial period had simply expired without a decision to keep him on in the position of chief scientists.\nBut Avital told Israel National News that there was no question that Saar decided not to keep him because of the Ma’ariv interview. “Apparently, he did not like it.”\nBeing a scientist who also believes strongly in the Bible, Avital was regularly attacked by the liberal Israeli media from the moment he was hired by the Education Ministry.\nThe most vicious attacks came from the radical left-wing newspaper Ha’aretz, which in addition to his views on evolution, faulted Avital for saying global warming is a farce used by liberal environmentalists to advance their political agendas.\nAvital has maintained that industry and technology have had only a very minor effect on the global temperatures and the climate in general, and that the “green” agenda is more about economic interests.\nAvital noted the ludicrous message that his firing sends - that a chief scientist, a recognized expert, cannot and should not be heard if his findings and views oppose those of the established mainstream."}

{"text": "In Julian Barnes' last book, essays on death called Nothing to Be Frightened Of, he wrote of fearing the nothingness or oblivion of death. In Pulse, his understated but stealthily moving third collection of stories, Barnes' main focus is on love and intimacy — how it starts, and what accounts for its endurance or failure to thrive. Many of his characters suffer the loss of one of their five senses, or of a close relationship.\nIn the title story, a 30-year-old only son contrasts his own dismal marriage to his parents' long, happy attachment. He wonders whether talent or luck is at the heart of a successful union. When his father confesses, after losing his sense of smell, that what he misses most is the scent of his wife, the son marvels at this intimate detail. Later, he pictures his father rubbing fresh herbs under his dying mother's nose after they learn that smell and sound are the last systems to shut down. \"Mum's dying, but Dad's losing her,\" he keeps reminding himself.\nBarnes, whose versatile output includes the historical novels Flaubert's Parrot and Arthur & George, travels back centuries in several stories. \"Harmony\" is an absorbing but peculiar tale about a gifted 18th-century Austrian pianist whose hysterical blindness is temporarily cured through unorthodox treatment. Basing his narrative on an actual case — Franz Mesmer's treatment of Maria Theresia von Paradis — Barnes makes the curious decision to uphold \"a routine literary mannerism\" of the era, suppressing so many details that the opening of his story reads like Mad Libs: \"The encounter between M— and Maria Theresia von P— took place in the imperial city of V— between the winter of 177— and the summer of the following year.\"\nSeveral stories involve 30-something men rebounding from heartache and venturing into new relationships. \"East Wind\" packs a wallop, as a divorced estate agent sabotages a promising affair by snooping into the painful past that his new girlfriend was trying to escape. In \"Trespass,\" a methodical hiker notes all the time one saves by being single — \"extra time in which to be lonely.\"\nA different sort of heartache is at the center of the powerful \"Marriage Lines,\" in which a man who has lost his wife to sudden illness — much as Barnes lost his wife, literary agent Pat Kavanaugh, to brain cancer in 2008 — travels back to where they vacationed happily in the Hebrides, and realizes, \"he was not in charge of grief. Grief was in charge of him.\"\nInterspersed through the first half of Pulse is a quartet of witty, clever dinner party conversations, \"At Phil & Joanna's,\" presented with little exposition. The tight-knit group of aging boomers who gather every few months manage to preserve their high spirits even as they banter about serious subjects, including American politics, global warming, health care, \"the marmalade theory of Britishness,\" and gender distinctions in talking about love and sex. These snappy running dialogues evoke Barnes' conversational novels, Talking It Over and Love, Etc., as well as Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. They also demonstrate, along with the other stories in this graceful collection, that Barnes has his finger firmly planted on the pulse of topics that continue to matter to us."}
{"text": "Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that phone records from nearly two dozen phone lines were obtained by the Department of Justice as part of what was likely an investigation into how AP reporters discovered the CIA’s involvement in foiling an Al Qaeda related bomb plot. As Hayes Brown explained yesterday, this investigation probably was motivated by concerns that reporting on CIA’s involvement could have compromised an intelligence operative working within Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns over DOJ’s actions here, potentially providing a rare opportunity to enact law restricting government surveillance. Moreover, there are strong arguments for why DOJ should be required to obtain a warrant from a judge before obtaining journalists’ phone records, especially in a case such as this one where DOJ’s need for the information does not appear to be imminent, the information sought is particularly broad, and the records are likely to remain available even after a delay.\nYet, if change is going to happen, it will likely have to come from what is currently the most dysfunctional branch of government — Congress — rather than the one that is currently most capable of bold action — the judiciary. Ultimately, this incident is likely to be a test of whether Congressional Democrats who opposed expansive surveillance during the Bush Administration will also have qualms with DOJ’s actions now that one of their own is in the White House; and whether Republicans, many of whom had a very different view of media surveillance just a year ago, will be able to pause their political posturing to pass a law preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.\nWhile the full details of the investigation have not been revealed — AP’s reporting on the surveillance was based largely on a letter DOJ sent to AP informing them of the surveillance — it is unlikely that DOJ’s actions violate the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court. No evidence has emerged that DOJ obtained the contents of actual conversations by AP reporters. Rather, their investigation appears to be limited to discovering which numbers were dialed by AP employees subject to surveillance, and possibly a similar investigation of their incoming calls.\nUnder the Supreme Court’s 1979 decision in Smith v. Maryland, the Constitution’s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures simply do not apply to this kind of surveillance. According to the five justices who joined the majority opinion, individuals do not have a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in the numbers they dial on their phones because “[t]elephone users . . . typically know that they must convey numerical information to the phone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this information; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for a variety of legitimate business purposes.” When information is voluntarily disclosed to a third party, the Court explained the person disclosing the information “assumed the risk that the information would be divulged to police.”\nThe best argument for applying a different rule to the AP is that journalists are different from other phone users. Journalists often depend on sources who will refuse to speak to a reporter if their conversation is not kept confidential. If government can discover who reporters have been speaking to, they will chill sources from providing information to journalists, and the public will ultimately be less well informed about the information they need to participate in a democracy. Most significantly, the First Amendment explicitly protects “the freedom of. . . the press,” so a strong textual argument can be made that activities that are essential to journalism enjoy heightened protection under the Constitution.\nThis argument, however, is unlikely to be embraced by our current Supreme Court. In Citizens United, the conservative justices did not just authorize corporations to spend unlimited money to influence elections, they also dismissed the idea that “the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers.” At least until one of these five justices leaves the bench, a robust interpretation of the First Amendment’s freedom of the press is unlikely.\nThe Constitution isn’t the beginning and the end of American law, and Justice Department regulations do place some significant restrictions on federal law enforcement’s ability to subpoena telephone records from journalists. Beyond requiring the surveillance of AP to eventually be disclosed to AP, they also typically require actions targeting journalists to be personally approved by the Attorney General. What they do not require, however, is for DOJ investigators to obtain a warrant before they conduct the surveillance at issue here. Placing this decision in the hands of the Attorney General is not nothing — the sheer volume of Eric Holder’s workload prevents him from personally reviewing and approving very many things — but it is also not an independent check on DOJ’s ability to target journalists.\nAt the moment, there appear to be a bipartisan consensus forming that the current checks on DOJ surveillance are not enough — at least in the media context. The question is whether Congress will actually decide to do something about it, or whether they will default to partisan posturing and reliance on a Supreme Court that shows little interest in protecting journalism.\nIn this case, the decision to seek AP phone records was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Attorney General Holder recused himself."}

Anyone who passed high school economics knows that path isn’t sustainable – not for the average family, and not for Washington.\nRecent emergencies have impressed upon us the importance of being calm and prepared for some of the unexpected or unanticipated twists and turns life sometimes surprises us with. People are much less likely to panic in a crisis – and thus prevail in a bad situation – if they have a plan and have their family prepared ahead of time so that everyone knows what they need to do.\nInformation and content related to Congress and the operations of the House of Representatives.\nHardworking American families are struggling, and Washington isn’t helping. Despite years of speeches, campaign promises, and trillion dollar deficit spending bills designed to jumpstart the economy, our economic engine remains stalled and too many of our friends and neighbors can’t find jobs\nAs a father, grandfather, businessman, and Congressman, I understand the importance of a quality education. Sadly, America has fallen behind in our responsibility of preparing the next generation with the best possible education.\nOne of America’s most important goals should be achieving energy independence. Our policies must reflect an “all-of-the-above” strategy, making greater use of our oil and natural gas reserves and promoting greater use of our technology. Instead of President Obama’s “war on coal,” we need common-sense policies to safely and effectively use America’s abundant resources, both renewable and non-renewable.\nThe financial services industry is critical to the Charlotte region’s economy.

We did not seek this privilege, but we accept the incredible responsibility. As a Nation, we do not step back from the challenge of doing the right thing.\nGun control is an emotional issue, and I have engaged in many heartfelt conversations with constituents on both sides of the issue. As a father and grandfather, I share the desire to prevent future tragedies like Sandy Hook and Aurora.\nAmericans are blessed with one of the greatest healthcare systems in the world, but rapidly rising costs necessitate reform. These reforms must increase access to affordable health insurance without creating a bloated government bureaucracy that comes between patient and doctor.\nSadly, today’s immigration system is badly broken. Because of misguided reforms in previous generations, we now lack a fair, orderly, and efficient immigration system. Far too many individuals are in the shadows of our society, while others are caught in a cycle of poverty and government dependency.\nAccording to the Constitution, the primary role of the Federal Government is to protect against threats, both foreign and domestic.\nOur economy is stuck in neutral. Raising taxes on hardworking Americans and small businesses is irresponsible and will further strangle economic growth. North Carolina families should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money and reinvest it into our economy.\nFew topics generate as much passion in the Charlotte region as traffic. Years of explosive growth and decades of neglect by Raleigh have created the perfect storm. Each year, the respected Texas Transportation Institute finds Charlotte has some of the worst congestion in the Nation.\nOur brave men and women in uniform are America’s real superheroes, the ones our children should admire. Suzanne and I join a grateful nation in honoring our active-duty military, veterans, and their families. North Carolina is home to almost 800,000 veterans and they are the pride of our state. One of the great privileges of serving as a United States Congressman is working to ensure our veterans have access to the benefits they have been promised."}

Each month will be dedicated to a new trait.\nThis month’s theme is Organization. How can we use picture books to model for students how authors choose to organize their writing?\nRecommended Grades: K-2\nI Wanna Iguana is a cute book of letters between a boy and his mother. Alex wants to convince his mother that he should receive his friend’s iguana when the friend moves. He provides plenty of reasons for his mother and his mother seems to refute each one. Will the boy receive the iguana in the end?\nLesson idea: Read aloud this book and discuss how the author organized the book into letters between mother and son. Also, discuss how Alex tries to persuade his mother to let him have the iguana. Read other models of books that are organized as letters. Dear Teacher by Amy Husband is another great model of a book organized as letters. Have students choose a topic and two characters to write letters back and forth. Perhaps combine with a unit on persuasion and have students write letters to have one character persuade another character to do something.\nIf you are looking for additional resources and ways to teach organization to students, find past posts under the Organization tag.\n**Note** I provide these lesson ideas under the assumption that you are familiar with The Six Traits of Writing.

At Homestead Dairy, it smells like money.\nThe family-run American farm invested in a biogas recovery system which transforms cow poo and other waste into electricity.\nEnough electricity, in fact, to power 1,000 homes, a service which the local utility company pays for handsomely.\nBut that's just a side benefit.\n\"It works economically, but one of the main reasons we did it was to try to help take care of the odor control for the neighbors,\" said Floyd Houin, whose family has owned the farm in Plymouth, Indiana since 1945.\n\"The land's important to us also because we produce a crop for feeding cows. So we want to do everything we can to take care of the land and the water. We drink the same water as everyone else.\"\nLivestock farms typically store their effluent in open lagoons and the stench does not make them very popular with the neighbors.\nThe lagoons also have a significant environmental impact because they emit methane and carbon dioxide—major contributors to climate change—and can sully the groundwater if they leak or overflow during heavy rains.\nSetting up an anaerobic digester—essentially a giant shed that uses heat to speed up decomposition—captures both the smell and the greenhouse gases.\nPower one million homes\nThe Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than three million tons of greenhouse gas emissions were eliminated last year by Homestead and the 246 other US livestock farms which have installed biogas recovery systems.\nThat's equivalent to taking more than 630,000 cars off the road.\nThere are about 8,000 dairy and hog farms in the United States which are large enough to make a biogas recovery system viable.\nThe EPA estimates they could generate enough electricity to power over a million homes and cut emissions by the equivalent of taking nearly four million cars off the road.\nBiogas recovery is also being used to capture methane from landfills and sewage treatment plants and even at craft beer companies.\n\"The federal government is really committed to seeing progress in this sector,\" said Allison Costa, program manager for the EPA's AgStar unit.\n\"Widespread investment and adoption could help us make significant inroads in helping us address some of our environmental and energy challenges.\"\nThe problem is the financing, Costa said. There's a huge upfront cost and most utility companies in the United States won't pay enough for the electricity to make the project appealing to a bank loan officer.\nIt also requires a lot of maintenance, which many farms don't have the manpower to manage. But when it works, Costa said, it really works.\n\"We've seen a lot of farms expand and build a second one,\" she told AFP.\n\"You just have to have someone willing to love that digester and take care of it.\"\nRyan Rogers, 31, loves his digester.\n\"There's so many (good) things, you forget them all,\" said Rogers, who married into the Homestead family and spends about four hours a day on digester maintenance and management.\nControlling the smell from the 70,000 gallons of manure and urine produced every day by the dairy's 3,400 cows clearly tops the list.\nThen of course, there's the crops. The digester does a much better job of turning the manure into fertilizer, which means a better yield from the farm's 4,500 acres of corn.\nOnce that nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer is extracted, what's left makes for some nice soft bedding for the cows.\nAnd instead of spending money to manage the manure, soon they'll be making money off it.\nRecover cost in five years\nThe family managed to get a grant to help cover some of the cost of the facility and a favorable contact with the local power company which was looking to expand its renewable energy supplies.\nThey bring in extra income—and fuel for the generators—by charging restaurants and food processing plants a lower rate to dump their waste than the local landfill.\nIt will probably only take about five years until the initial investment is fully paid off, Rogers said. And it's working so well they're planning to build a second facility.\n\"It's definitely a growing field within the United States,\" said Mike Fenton of Michigan CAT, which sold the Caterpillar generators used by Homestead and helps them to maintain the system.\nThe European market is much more advanced because there are so many more subsidies available and the cost of electricity is so much higher, he said.\nWhile US farmers may balk at the initial cost—a system like the one at Homestead would run around $6 million—Fenton said it's a good investment. Most farms can pay it off and start making a profit within three to five years.\n\"It's a proven technology that works really well,\" he told AFP.\n© 2015 AFP"}

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced another $15 million in aid, for a total of almost $45 million, for what she called the \"unarmed opposition.\"\nBy Michael Martinez\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exhorted the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday to draw \"a clear red line\" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\nIn a theatrical gesture, Netanyahu held up a cartoon-like drawing of a spherical bomb and drew a red line below the fuse, \"before Iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment to make a bomb,\" he said.\n\"It's not a question of whether Iran will get the bomb. The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb,\" said Netanyahu, who also accused Iran of aggression.\n\"I ask, given this record of Iranian aggression without nuclear weapons, just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons,\" the Israeli prime minister said. \"Who among you would feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would be safe anywhere?\"\nBy David Ariosto\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his nation was committed to peace and accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race, as he took to the stage Wednesday at the United Nations General Assembly.\nHis address on day two of the general debate was widely expected to prove contentious, given the Iranian leader's history of controversial statements, but he made no mention of Israel.\nAt times, his remarks seemed almost conciliatory.\nSpeaking from the assembly's iconic green marble podium, Ahmadinejad told delegates that Iran has a \"global vision and welcomes any effort intended to provide and promote peace, stability and tranquility\" in the world.\nHowever, an \"arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction by the hegemonic powers have become prevalent,\" he said, and Iran finds itself under threat from world powers seeking to impose their views.\n\"Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,\" he said. \"A state of mistrust has cast its shadow on the international relations, while there is no trusted or just authority to help resolve world conflicts.\"\nIt was the Iranian president's eighth and final address to the assembly, with his final term in office coming to an end next year.\nAs Ahmadinejad spoke, the place set aside for the U.S. delegation was empty. The Canadian delegation also did not attend the speech, and Israel's representatives were absent in observance of Yom Kippur.\nBy Joe Vaccarello\nWorld leaders flock to the United Nations this week for the 67th annual session of the General Assembly.\nThe general debate is expected to draw participation from 116 heads of state and government leaders. Foreign ministers and other government representatives will fill out the rest of the attendance roster of the 193-member world body.\nWhile the focus is usually on the leaders' speeches in the General Assembly hall, there will be a lot of activity happening inside and outside the U.N. complex with high-level meetings and bi-lateral country to country talks.\nHere's a guide to what to look for:\nEditor’s note: This analysis is part of Security Clearance blog’s “Debate Preps” series. On November 22, CNN, along with AEI and The Heritage Foundation, will host a Republican candidate debate focused on national security topics. In the run-up to the debate, Security Clearance asked both the sponsoring conservative think tanks to look at the key foreign policy issues and tell us what they want to hear candidates address.\nThe U.S. is far and away the major financial backer of the United Nations. Yet the world body often embraces resolutions and policies at odds with American positions and interests. Should the U.S. exercise its “power of the purse” to influence the U.N.?\nOn occasion, the U.S. has done just that, withholding contributions to express its extreme displeasure with actions taken in Turtle Bay. But the Obama administration rejected this tactic early on. Instead, in his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama proudly announced a “new era of engagement” with the U.N. President Obama’s Ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, likewise considers withholding to be a practice that is “fundamentally flawed in concept and practice, sets us back, is self-defeating, and doesn’t work.”\nSo how’s that working? The Palestinian Authority’s recent doings in Turtle Bay are instructive.\nCNN Senior State Department Producer Elise Labott takes you inside Secretary of State Clinton's motorcade.\nIn the second part of CNN's exclusive behind-the scenes look at the State Department's operations at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Senior State Department Producer Elise Labott shows us the detailed preparations that go into setting up a photo opportunity between the Secretary of State and a foreign diplomat.\nFrom Sr. State Dept Producer Elise Labott reporting from the UN General Assembly\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to tell President Obama during their one-on-one meeting today that he will deliver a letter to the UN Security Council seeking statehood but will not expect the United Nations to act immediately, Palestinian officials tell CNN. The officials say Abbas would deliver the letter sometime before he leaves the U.S. on Friday.\nThe officials say Abbas plans to give the UN and U.S. several weeks to respond to the letter—temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown. Abbas will wait for a response from the Quartet, the officials tell CNN and sometime thereafter is likely to go back to the UN General Assembly to negotiate statehood, working through the UN Security Council.\nThe goal is to pressure a vote by the UN General Assembly legitimizing Palestinian statehood.\nBy Jamie Crawford and Elise Labott reporting from the UN General Assembly\nShe may be out of Washington and on the road for the week, but the heavy machinery of office has followed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New York as she attends the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings.\nTo be sure, the secretary always has a traveling staff with her wherever she may be in the world. But UNGA, with its hundreds of diplomats, ministers and heads of state converging on New York every September, is a much different animal from a trip to a world capitol. Basically, Foggy Bottom moves up to the Big Apple and sets up a mini-State Department on the 24th floor of the Waldorf Astoria.\nCNN was granted rare and exclusive access to this massive operation, one that involves hundreds of employees, planeloads full of equipment and a ton of coffee.\nAs we exited the elevator on the 24th floor, it became clear this was indeed a secure work space, with numerous Diplomatic Security guards and several signs reminding staff not to discuss classified information in the hallways.\nIt seemed as if U.S. foreign policy hadn't skipped a beat despite being a few hundred miles removed from home base. With the beds in each room removed (though the head boards where still bolted to the wall), the rooms have been transformed into working offices with secure telephone lines, computers, fax machines and all of the equipment needed to do the job of executing the nation's diplomacy.\nAs we were escorted down one of the halls, Ambassador Capricia Penavic Marshall, the department's chief of protocol, was working with her staff to prepare for what was already shaping up to be an marathon of a week. Marshall's office is responsible for advising on matters of international diplomatic protocol, making sure the right atmosphere is created for conducting diplomacy. FULL POST\nBy Sr. State Department Producer Elise Labott reporting from the UN General Assembly\nThe international community is working on a package of initiatives to avoid a diplomatic showdown over Palestinian statehood at the U.N. Security Council this week.\nWhile there are a number of ideas in play, senior U.S., European, Israeli and Palestinian officials have told CNN they center around Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas delivering a letter to the Security Council seeking full Palestinian statehood, but not forcing a Council vote.\nThe Security Council letter would be paired with a statement by the Mideast Quartet laying out the terms of reference to re-launch peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, the officials said. The quartet is made up of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia.\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Monday night in an effort to get Russian to buy into the plan.\nQuartet envoys will meet for a third day Tuesday afternoon to work on the text. The core elements include a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with agreed upon swaps, recognition of two states for two peoples - the Palestinians and the Jewish people - and a time line for a peace deal, diplomats said.\nThe officials said a package deal could enable Abbas to claim victory by going to the Security Council, but would not force a confrontation with the United States, which has promised to veto any statehood resolution which comes before the Council.

{"text": "SYDNEY:12 April (South News) At an anti-NATO protest Sunday, the mood against the bombing of Yugoslavia was captured from a 14-year-old girl.\nDusanka Radan stepped to the podium with a speech and a rose. She read a letter she had sent to US President Bill Clinton to the estimated 6000 protesters in the city's Domain.\nHer plea to Mr Clinton to \"stop the bombing\" made grown men wipe away tears.\n\"I'm very upset at what's happening in Yugoslavia and I beg you stop the bombing of innocent people\", she cried. \"It really upsets me to see children my age and younger suffering in terrible conditions.\n\"You should never give up talking and negotiating when two people are having an argument and you are trying to find a solution,\" she said.\"Even if one side is wrong, you have punished everybody and turned life upside-down for Serbians and Albanians.\"\n\"Bombing children and innocent people is not going to end this war,\" she read through tears, while some of the crowd also wept. \"Please, please, please stop the bombing and get talking.\"\nLike most other protesters on the Serbian Orthodox Church's Easter Sunday, she wore a paper bullseye and the word \"target\" on her chest.\nSpeeches from the Serbian community condemned NATO, President Clinton and the Western media's coverage of the war. Spokesman Ilija Glisic called on the Australian Government \"to do what it can to stop the bombing and resume the peace process\".\n\"It's time that the Government and opposition parties alike started using the special relationship with the Americans to do something for peace, not war,\" he said. Glisic from the Serbian National Federation also accused the media was only presenting Nato's side of the conflict in order to prepare public opinion for the introduction of NATO ground troops.\nOther speakers alleged that it was NATO bombing that was driving Kosovar refugees from their homeland, not Serbian forces. Demonstrators wore target signs on their backs and waved Serbian flags, among the sea of flags were some Australian, Greek, Macedonian, Italian and Polish flags.\nPolice put on their biggest turn-out since the anti-Vietnam War marches were stationed around the city in readiness, after violence at rallies around Australia at the beginning of Nato bombing weeks ago. About 950 police monitored the protest and guarded the United States Consulate-General offices in the MLC Building at Martin Place.\nThe protest coincided with Serbian Orthodox Easter celebrations. Easter, the anniversary of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, was observed by some 300 million Orthodox on Sunday. Roman Catholics and Protestants celebrated Easter a week earlier.\nDespite Easter celebrations, allied bombings against Yugoslavia continued overnight Sunday.The bombings have led to an outpouring of faith in Yugoslavia, where thousands of Serbs attended midnight Mass, defying the warnings of air-raid sirens."}

And even the pregnant women, they cut open their stomachs. . . . I saw my father being killed. They cut him to pieces.\nPlacide Uwinagiye, another survivor of the holocaust in Rwanda\nThe graves are only half full who will help us to fill them?\nThe Hutu radio, exhorting Hutus to finish off the Tutsis, Rwanda, 1994\nIn March 1998, William Jefferson Clinton and the First Lady arrived in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. The hundreds of thousands of corpses had been somehow removed, and the president of the United States told the dignitaries greeting him at the airport:\n\"It may seem strange to you here, especially the many of you who lost members of your family, but all over the world there were people like me sitting in offices, day after day after day, who did not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror.\"\nClinton's culpability in this holocaust is not an impeachable offense, but it is the single most repellent charge against him and his administration.\nIn his extraordinarily detailed and probing book, We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998), Philip Gourevitch says plainly that \"throughout the entire period\" of the genocide, the Clinton administration's approach was not a failure to intervene but \"a success of a policy not to intervene.\"(Emphasis added.)\nCarrying out the Clinton policy of letting the killing continue was Madeleine Albright, then our ambassador to the United Nations. Says Gourevitch:\n\"Her name is rarely associated with Rwanda, but ducking and pressuring others to duck as the death toll leapt from thousands to tens of thousands was the absolute low point in her career as a stateswoman.\"\nClinton's name is also rarely associated with Rwanda. The American press noted the corpses at the time, but largely failed to begin to cover Clinton's complicity in this crime against humanity, as it essentially failed to cover Franklin Roosevelt's refusal to rescue Jews from the Nazis.\nMore and more of the bloody facts emerge. Gourevitch first began to tell the story in the December 18, 1995, issue of The New Yorker. Whatever Tina Brown's mistakes as editor of that magazine, her financial and personal support of Gourevitch during the many months of his research and writing was a lasting and honorable achievement.\nOn January 26, 1999, more of the ghastly story of Rwanda (and the rest of the world's determination to avert its eyes) was told on PBS's Frontline, in a report called \"The Triumph of Evil.\" Since 1983, Frontlinehas been the only television series to equal the standards set by Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly at CBS, back in the days when network news operations covered foreign affairs and atrocities in penetrating depth.\nWatching \"The Triumph of Evil,\" Bill Steigerwald of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazettehad the same reaction I did to Clinton's \"apology\" four years later in Rwanda:\n\"Before presenting the president of Rwanda a tacky plaque honoring the victims of a holocaust that consumed at least 800,000 humans in 100 days, Clinton made a vague apology for the failure of the international community to fully appreciate 'the depth and the speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror.'\n\"But by the time the president is seen making that carefully worded statement at the end of 'Triumph of Evil,' Frontline has exposed it to be a shameful lie.\"\nNext week, the story behind that shameful lie. And at the end of this series, I will again ask how the American left can continue to insist that this man remain in office. Clinton has corrupted many of the most decent people I have known in previous battles against injustice.\nIn an earlier Frontlineprogram on the holocaust (\"Valentina's Nightmare,\" April 1, 1997), the narrator tells of what happened in a churchyard in a remote village, Nyarbuye, in southeast Rwanda. There, where 13-year-old Valentina Iribagiza became an orphan, \"the house of God had become one of Rwanda's most terrible killing grounds.\"\nIn April 1994, a mob of Hutus surrounded the village church as the radio blared: \"All Tutsi will perish. They will disappear from the earth. Slowly, slowly, we will kill them like rats.\"\nValentina remembers: \"Their leader said we were snakes. That was when they started to cut people up.\"\nAnd the order came from the Oval Office not to intervene.\nThis month, Bill Clinton was listed as one of the nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize."}

{"text": "The inti was the currency of Peru between 1985 and 1991. It was introduced on 1 February 1985, replacing the sol which had suffered from high inflation. One inti was equivalent to 1,000 soles. Coins denominated in the new unit were put into circulation from May 1985 and banknotes followed in June of that year.\nBy 1990, the inti had itself suffered from high inflation. As an interim measure, from January to July 1991, the “inti en millones” was used as a unit of account. One inti en millones was equal to 1,000,000 intis and hence to one new sol. The nuevo sol (“new sol”) was adopted on 1 July 1991. Inti notes and coins are no longer legal tender in Peru, nor can they be exchanged for notes and coins denominated in the current nuevo sol.\nThe Nuevo Sol\nThe name is a return to that of Peru’s historic currency, the Sol in use from the 19th century to 1985. Although the derivation of Sol is the Latin solidus, the word also happens to mean sun in Spanish. There is a continuity therefore with the old Peruvian inti, which was named after Inti, the Sun God of the Incas.\nBecause of the bad state of economy and hyperinflation in the late 1980s the government was forced to abandon theinti and introduce the nuevo sol as the country’s new currency. The currency was put into use on July 1, 1991 to replace the inti at a rate of 1 nuevo sol to 1,000,000 intis. Coins denominated in the new unit were introduced on October 1, 1991 and the first banknotes on November 13, 1991. Hitherto the Nuevo Sol currently retains a low inflation rate of 1.5%, the lowest inflation rate ever in both Latin and South America. Since the new currency was put into effect, it has managed to maintain a stable exchange rate between 2.3 and 3.65 per United States dollar."}

{"text": "Japan deserves chance to engage\nAwarding the 2020 Olympic Games to Tokyo was the right decision, despite fears of nuclear contamination in Fukushima\nStanding in front of the mirror with the lights off, I was waiting to see if I would start to glow. It was still dark so I guessed it was a case of so far, so good because apparently I was risking radioactive contamination just by being in Tokyo. I am not trying to make light of a serious issue, but I really had no idea about the potential for disaster simply by visiting Japan last week.\nBecause it was the much-anticipated week that the IOC announced its host city for the 2020 Olympic Games, much was made of radiation leaks stemming from the earthquake and tsunami that hit Fukushima in March of 2011 and how it would doom the Japanese bid. However, among the three finalists Tokyo appeared to be the least flawed compared to Madrid and Istanbul.\nThe Spanish economy has been absolutely devastated and with serious issues facing the completion of construction in Rio De Janeiro for 2016, the IOC wanted nothing to do with a similar scenario in 2020. The Syrian conflict raging on Turkey's border and a spate of brutal crackdowns against anti-government activists in Istanbul lately pretty much doomed that bid. That left Tokyo - more or less by default - as the winner in a surprising landslide vote.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe flew to the IOC conference in Buenos Aries to assure one and all that the radiation was not an issue and had been suitably contained. With visions of Japanese efficiency dancing through their minds, Abe's appeal seemed to placate most of the IOC members. \"If there's another earthquake or something like that, that's not something you can blame the prime minister for,\" said IOC member Dick Pound. Indeed.\nMost of us have no idea what the world will look like one year from now, never mind in seven years. One thing is certain though, if Tokyo is radioactive in 2020 from the after effects of a tsunami almost 10 years earlier, then holding a nuclear-free Olympics will be the least of the worries. Japan as we know it will likely not even exist and if the Olympics has to be cancelled because of an apocalypse, well then, boo-hoo to the IOC. The Games are a big deal but they aren't that big.\nThe decision comes after Tokyo's unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Olympics four years earlier. On technical merits alone it was judged the most complete bid then. But one of the main criticisms from voters was a lack of passion among organisers and the general populace in Japan. Despite the fact that the IOC often misses the mark on so many of its decisions, it was right about the laissez-faire attitude of most Japanese towards the 2016 Games.\nJapan is for the Japanese and always has been. There is certainly no crime in that because you have to look out for number one. But when they try to engage the rest of world it often makes for some awkward moments. In 2002 when Japan co-hosted the soccer World Cup with South Korea, there was but a single tournament banner hanging at Narita airport to greet global arrivals and aside from a few pockets of revelry, Tokyo was largely muted.\nIt seemed like Japan wanted to host the World Cup, they just didn't want to host the world. In South Korea, the country was blanketed with World Cup paraphernalia and the buzz was inescapable. Consequently, the level of English among the general populace in Seoul is now vastly superior to that spoken in Tokyo. For a sprawling metropolis of over 35 million people and one of the world's truly great cities, Tokyo can be a very inhospitable place for non-Japanese speakers. The people certainly try and they are easily the most courteous human beings on the face of the earth. But because their leaders have never placed a high priority on internationalising their focus, they are reduced to greeting visitors with an endless series of bowing and apologising.\nThings have drastically changed in Japan since four years ago and after one of the most devastating natural disasters of our time, the country is looking to reassert itself, particularly with China eclipsing it on the global stage. An ultra-nationalist, Abe is far from a natural diplomat. While he did spend the week successfully playing nice to the IOC, if he goes back into his xenophobic shell it will all be for naught. For a country that has been going backwards both economically and diplomatically over the past 20 years, hosting the world in 2020 could not come at a more opportune time."}

Yes, ecclesiastics do have additional interests, because their allegiance is, or should be, somewhat divided.* But hasn't there been enough work done, at least for the Franks, that we can now assume that the two groups are generally related to each other by kinship, and that, especially in the cases of proprietary churches and monasteries (or royal ones), the holders of ecclesiastical office are doing it precisely because they are connected by blood to the lay elites?\nOr am I missing something important?\n*should be in the sense that they are supposed to be looking out for the church's property and interests, whoever their relatives."}

{"text": "Méthode de modélisation-simulation\nAgile Logistics Simulation and Optimization for Managing Disaster Responses F. Barahona, M. Ettl, M. Petrik, P.M. Rimshnick, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Proceedings of the 2013 Winter Simulation Conference\nCatastrophic events such as hurricanes, earthquakes or floods require emergency responders to rapidly distribute emergency relief supplies to protect the health and lives of victims. In this paper we develop a simulation and optimization framework for managing the logistics of distributing relief supplies in a multi-tier supply network. The simulation model captures optimized stocking of relief supplies, distribution operations at federal or state-operated staging facilities, demand uncertainty, and the dynamic progression of disaster response operations. We apply robust optimization techniques to develop optimized stocking policies and dispatch of relief supplies between staging facilities and points of distribution. The simulation framework accommodates a wide range of disaster scenarios and stressors, and helps assess the efficacy of response plans and policies for better disaster response.\nDisaster response supply chain management simulation modeling and optimization\nDisaster response requires that emergency supplies are distributed rapidly and widely across the affected area. Many national and regional agencies operate supply chains designed to respond to a large variety of disasters. These supply chains differ significantly from commercial supply chains. First, the delivery of goods is not driven by optimizing profits but instead by fulfilling humanitarian needs. Second, while commercial supply chains can be designed and refined to slowly changing customer demand, the supply chains in disaster response must be set up rapidly with little advance warning and often with little precise information. Because disasters usually result in improvements in infrastructure and response plans, the next disaster typically differs significantly from historical patterns. As a result, there is generally insufficient historical data to construct faithful models of damage and the demand for emergency supplies.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of inventory level and delivery optimization and simulationg in a supply chain during a disaster response. These are typical logistical challenges faced by government emergency management agencies. Emergency response agencies often rely on supplies that are stored long-term in a small number of large warehouses; we refer to them as Distribution Centers (DC). During a response, the response agencies must transport numerous emergency supplies through a number of intermediate processing points to Points of Distribution (PODs) where they are distributed to the affected population. We refer to the intermediate processing nodes as Staging Areas (SAs). Once established during the disaster response, both PODs and SAs can hold inventories to respond to shifting demand needs. Figure 1 shows an example of a supply chain structure."}

{"text": "Nineteenth-century Italian cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, a legend in his day, was said to speak 72 languages. Hungarian hyperpolyglot Lomb Kató, who taught herself Russian by reading Russian romance novels, insisted that \"one learns grammar from language, not language from grammar.\" Legendary MIT linguist Ken Hale, who passed away in 2001, had an arsenal of 50 languages and was rumored to have once learned the notoriously difficult Finnish while on a flight to Helsinki. Just like extraordinary feats of memory, extraordinary feats of language serve as a natural experiment probing the limits of the human brain -- Mezzofanti maintained that \"God\" had given him this particular power, but did these linguistic superlearners really possess some significant structural advantage over the rest of us in how their brains were wired? That's precisely what journalist and self-described \"metaphor designer\" Michael Erard explores in Babel No More: The Search for the World's Most Extraordinary Language Learners -- the first serious investigation into the phenomenon of seemingly superhuman multilingual dexterity and those who have, or claim to have, mastered it, and a fine addition to our favorite books about language.\nTo understand the cognitive machinery of such feats, Erard set out to find modern-day Mezzofantis, from an eccentric Berkeley-based language learning guru and hyperpolyglot -- hyperglottery, Erard notes, begins at 11 languages -- to the Lebanese-born, Brazil-based one-time Guinness record holder for 58 languages, who proceeded to embarrass himself on Chilean national television by not understanding a simple question by a native speaker. In the process, Erard scrutinizes the very nature of language, its cultural role, and where it resides in the brain, weaving a fascinating story about our most fundamental storytelling currency.\nTo grasp the power of language learning as a social facilitator, one need only stroll into a busy Manhattan restaurant, where mapping the native origin of the staff and patrons might produce a near-complete world atlas. Erard marvels:\nIt's amazing that the world runs so well, given that people use languages that they didn't grow up using, haven't studied in schools, and in which they've never been tested or certified. Yet it does.\n(For some related fascination, see David Bellos' Is That a Fish in Your Ear?, which delves into what translation reveals about the human condition.)\nAnd in an age where geography and nationality have been shuffled the forces of globalization, ubiquitous connectivity, cheap travel, and the Internet, understanding how language lubricates our social interactions is crucial to making sense of our place in a global world. Erard observes:\nIdeas, information, goods, and people are flowing more easily through space, and this is creating a sensibility about language learning that's rooted more in the trajectories of an individual's life than in one's citizenship or nationality. It's embedded in economic demands, not the standards of schools or governments. That means that our brains also have to flow, to remain plastic and open to new skills and information. One of these skills is learning new ways to communicate.\n(The Daily Beast has an excerpt to give you a taste of Erard's signature blend of absorbing storytelling and rigorous research.)\nCaptivating and illuminating, Babel No More is as much an absorbing piece of investigative voyeurism into superhuman feats as it is an intelligent invitation to visit the outer limits of our own cerebral potential.\nImage: Free Press.\nThis post also appears on Brain Pickings, an Atlantic partner site."}
{"text": "16 July 2011\nShadrach, Meshach and Abednego were three young Jews, of royal or noble birth from the Kingdom of Judah, who were inducted into Babylon when Jerusalem was occupied by the Babylonians in 606/605 BC, under the campaign of Nebuchadnezzar II, during the first deportation of the Israelites.\nTheir Hebraic names were Hananiah (חֲנַנְיָה), Mishael (מִישָׁאֵל) and Azariah (עֲזַרְיָה). It was probably by the King’s decree that Chief Official Ashpenaz assigned Chaldean names, so that Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach and Azariah became Abednego.[Daniel 1: 3, 7]\nThese three young men were very dear to Daniel, whose Chaldean name was Belteshazzar, a peer who spoke highly of the three to the King whenever opportunity afforded itself, so that they could also have honorable positions in the Province of Babylon.\nIn Daniel (Daniy'el) Chapter 1, King Nebuchadnezzar wanted select men from Judah to learn the language and literature of Babylon. This would be a three-year training course to qualify those select to serve in the King’s Palace. Those chosen were to partake of Babylonian royal food and wine. [v.3-5] Among these men of Judah were Daniel (Belteshazzar), Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. [v.6, 7] Because Daniel did not want to defile himself with the King’s food, he requested from his appointed guard to provide them vegetables and water for ten days. After the ten day trial, the four appeared better nourished and healthier than all the others who partook of the royal food. Thus they were awarded the freedom to regularly have vegetables and water. [v.8-16] Upon the King’s review, he also found them to be “ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm”.\nIn Daniel Chapter 3, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were sent into a blazing fiery furnace because of their stand to exclusively serve their God alone. By the Son of God in the form of an angel, they were delivered out of harm’s way from this order of execution by the King of Babylon.\nThe story takes place during the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, who had a nine-story high statue made of gold erected in the plain of Dura[v.1] (The region around present day Karbala, Iraq). The statue was either an image of himself or possibly of the Babylonian god of wisdom, known as Nabu. When the project was complete, he prepared a dedication ceremony to this image ordering all surrounding inhabitants to bow down and worship it. The consequence for not worshiping the idol, upon hearing the queue of instruments, was execution in a fiery furnace.[v.2-9] During the dedication ceremony, certain officials noticed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego not bowing down to the idol. Thus, Nebuchadnezzar was immediately notified.[v.10-12]\nThe King was enraged and demanded that these three men come before him.[v.13] Nebuchadnezzar knew of these very men, because it wasn’t too long ago when Daniel had petitioned the King to assign Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon.[Daniel 2: 48, 49] Daniel was also very special to the King because he was able to interpret his dreams unlike any of the Chaldean wise men.[Daniel 2: 24, 25] So it is of no surprise that the King would offer one more chance for these three Jews, who held honorable positions to the King, to show their patriotism to Babylon.[v.14, 15]\nTheir response: \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\"[v.16-18]\nNebuchadnezzar demanded that the execution furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual. Valiant soldiers of the King’s army were ordered to firmly bind the fully clothed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and cast them in the blazing furnace. Upon approaching the mouth of the furnace, the fire was so hot that the soldiers perished while attempting to throw in the three tightly bound Jews (who then fell in).[v.19-23]\nThe SOn of God in the form of an angel immediately came to deliver the three men from the furnace releasing them from their ties. When the King saw what appeared to be four men in the furnace, unbound and walking about, he called to them to come out. King Nebuchadnezzar then acknowledged the power of their God, even going as far as to make a decree, whereby any nation who says anything against the God of the Jews is an act of war. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were then given promotions to their positions over the province of Babylon.[v.24-30]\nIn the \"Prayer of Azariah\", passage of the Septuagint, Azariah (Abednego) confesses their sins and the sins of Israel, and asks their God to save them in order to demonstrate God’s power to the Babylonians. It is followed by an account of an angel who came to make the inside of the furnace feel like a cool breeze over dew. An extended hymn of praise to their God for deliverance is found in the \"Song of the Three Young Men\".\nIn view of the possible foreign religious connotations attached to their names, commentators have questioned why the Bible seldom uses their original Hebrew names. It is speculated that they are identified mostly by their Chaldean names to maintain the accuracy of the dialogue given in the text. Since it would have been confusing to have the writer call them one thing and the King call them another, the story primarily uses their Chaldean names instead.\nHananiah is a Hebrew name that means \"God who is gracious\". Misha'el means \"Who is like God?” and it also means \"to feed\" or \"to provide\" as in how a husband provides for his family. The Hebrew name Azariah appropriately means \"God has helped\".\nIt has been asserted that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego's names all pertained to pagan Babylonian gods. Shadrach possibly is derived from Shudur Aku \"Command of the moon god\". Meshach is probably a variation of Mi•sha•aku \"Who is what Aku is?\", an interesting twist from the Hebrew name Mishael “Who is like Yahweh?” Abednego is either a corrupted or deliberate use of Abednebo, \"servant of Nebo/Nabu,\" or Abednergo, a variation of Abednergal, \"servant of the god Nergal.\"\nThe song of the three youths is alluded to in odes seven and eight of the canon, a hymn sung in the matins service and on other occasions in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where their feast day is December 17 (along with Daniel). The Orthodox also commemorate them on the two Sundays before the Nativity of Christ. The reading of the story of the fiery furnace, including the song, is prescribed for the vesperal Divine Liturgy celebrated by the Orthodox on Holy Saturday. Likewise, the three are commemorated as prophets in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on December 17 with Daniel."}
{"text": "Visual Business Intelligence (VBI) is knowledge based on the application of visual data to a business problem or opportunity.\nThe process of visual business intelligence starts with the collection of visual data which is analyzed to create unique information. This information becomes knowledge when it is applied to a business problem or opportunity. For example, visual data is collected from a retail store (the number of customers who enter an area of interest, the time they spend there and what direction they traveled). This data is analyzed and becomes information (the answer to a simple question such as how long are people waiting in line?). In turn it becomes knowledge (the application of the data to business such as reducing wait times and decreasing departures by opening additional cash registers between 11am and 2PM on weekends or when more than five people are waiting in line). The opportunity then exists to move further to forecast and even model physical customer behavior.\n“Businesses have only begun to tap the capabilities of visual business intelligence. I see a future where we wonder how anyone operated a business without some level of VBI as part of their day to day business decision making.” -Martin Renkis Smartvue Corporation"}

Whitefly (covered by a white waxy powder) adults are small \"dandruff\" size insects. When plants are disturbed, the whiteflies flutter around the plant and soon return to the plant to continue feeding.\nWhitefly species that are damaging to cultivated plants are not cold hardy in Illinois. To survive our winter they must be on plants indoors (house plants, herbs and greenhouse crops). The insects (usually in the egg stage when they are difficult to see) are often shipped north on flower and vegetable transplants grown in the south. The insects tend to feed mostly on the lower side of the leaves. Eggs are primarily laid on the upper leaves of the plant, but the clear, tiny, oval nymphs occur primarily on the lower leaves.\nOn indoor plants one can try using yellow sticky traps to capture the adults. These work much better if the foliage is disturbed daily, causing the whiteflies to fly off of the plant. Infestations can also be reduced by discarding heavily infested plants. Outdoors, use suggested insecticides according to all label directions and precautions. Insecticidal soap, summer oil, and chemical insecticides are effective. On vegetables, be sure to follow the recommended time interval between treating the plants and harvesting the crop. If there is no pre-harvest interval,DO NOT use that insecticide on the food crop.\nFiled under plants: Vegetables\nFiled under problems: Insects Damage"}

I've written in the past that $15bn per year is a good number given the \"Venture Capital Math Problem.\"\nMy concern is that investing went up in the second half of the year to a $5bn/quarter rate, which is $20bn run rate, a bit above the number that I think is optimal for the industry's returns.\n2010 will be an interesting year. If VC investments go back up to $25bn to $30bn per year, then the diet didn't stick and we are back to an overfunded industry that will produce subpar returns on average.\nIf, on the other hand, the new normal is $15bn to $20bn per year, then the diet worked and we've scaled back the business to healthy levels.\nStay tuned and find out which one it is."}

{"text": "An Amazing Story: Traveling to Planet ‘Public Domain’\nThis is the cover of the October 1948 issue of Amazing Stories, which some neglector of intellectual property has prematurely let fall into the public domain. Project Gutenberg has a bunch of amazing artwork and history like this that you might find with a search of [science fiction covers].\nI love the teaser for the featured story, The Brain: “A Giant Calculating Machine Decides To Rule The world!” A calculating machine! And it has decided to rule the world!\nProject Gutenberg is one of my favorite sites on the internet. Their more-than-five year mission: “To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.” Free electronic books. Free as in free beer and freedom.\nI think they mostly draw from the public domain, which means most of their stuff is from the 1920s or earlier, so I was surprised to see these publications from the 1940s and 1950s. But each of them is accompanied by the note, “Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.”\nAlthough I bet this rankles some people. The public domain isn’t very popular with a certain crowd. I can imagine them being offended by this idea that stuff should become “free.” (That it must be free.) These cultural nitwits probably see this as an egregious oversight by the copyright owners. They don’t get that our current copyright system is wrecking the commons. They’re fools if they don’t see how they benefit from “free culture” for everything they do.\nIt makes me sad that copyright has become effectively forever. So much stuff could be entering the public domain every year even with the previous too-long maximum term of 56 years. Take a look at Duke University’s depressing summary of what would have become available this year, but now we likely won’t see freed in our lifetimes.\n(More specifically, the summary is from Duke Law School’s “Center for the Study of the Public Domain.” They put one together every year and publish it as a special New Year’s Day bummer.)\nBut at least there is Project Gutenberg and other rocket ships, helping us to occasionally travel to that amazing planet, ‘Public Domain,’ where we can see and use and share our common culture, even as it recedes fast into the past.\nAnd many of us are committed to sharing our own present day work as much as possible, and allowing it to be shared in turn. I generally use the Creative Commons ShareAlike license instead of dedicating my work to the public domain, because I want to promote that idea — that our culture is a commons, and we should share it freely. You can use my work, but to the extent that I have “power” to tell you what you can do with it, I only ask that you share the work under the same terms if you decide to use it.\nWe share a common culture. It’s our culture, and little pieces of it shouldn’t be “owned” by anyone. (I’m speaking of the pieces that exist as bits and bytes, of course. The copyable parts.)\nI suppose this might seem like science fiction to many, but science fiction has a way of predicting how things will go with giant calculating machines and other weird concepts. It will be the future soon enough. We’ll figure out better ways to deal with all this “stuff.” For now, we can opt in easily enough. Please, copy and share my words!"}

Through the use of the “5 Es”, engineering, education, enforcement, evaluation, and encouragement, programs are developed to create a safe, appealing environment for walking and biking to school that encourages a healthy and active lifestyle from an early age. Safe Routes to School enriches the quality of children’s lives and benefits communities by implementing projects that will reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and enhance neighborhood safety. Safe Routes to School also has the potential to reduce the alarming nationwide trend in child obesity and inactivity.\nIn 1969, approximately 50% of children walked or biked to school, and 87% of the children living within one mile of their school arrived under their own power. Today, fewer than 15% of schoolchildren walk or bike to school. In addition, parents driving their children to school can generate as much as 20% to 30% of morning traffic. Over the last 25 years, air pollution has been linked to a 74% increase in asthma rates among children ages 5-14, and a 160% increase in children up to age 4.\nThe Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) has administered a SRTS program since 2007 and has approved over $ 7 million in awards to over 75 schools across Alabama. The City of Huntsville was awarded a $200,000 SRTS grant in 2008 and is planning to apply for another one in November 2010. Contact James Moore for more information.

The plan identifies 39 different bike routes to be constructed throughout the city within a five year period. All routes will be identified with signage. The total bicycle network identified in the plan will include approximately 160 miles of bikeway facilities in addition to the ten existing transit routes, which will encourage and promote bicycling while increasing transit ridership.\nFunding for the five year project will be provided by the City of Huntsville and through state and federal grants.

{"text": "You want your workers to be safe — of course you do. But it isn’t just compassion that makes workplace safety important. Non-fatal workplace injuries hurt your business and your bottom line, too. In fact, it’s been estimated that employers pay out almost $1 billion per week for workers’ compensation costs alone.\nAnd that’s not even the whole cost of injury — there are indirect costs, too, such as training replacement employees, accident investigation, implementation of corrective measures, productivity loss, repairs to damaged equipment and property, and even the costs associated with lowered morale and absenteeism. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) statistics show that there are over 25,000 slip-and-fall injuries in the workplace every day. And even worse, studies show that the rate of falls among industrial employees is rising.\nSo how can you avoid “falling” into the same traps as other businesses? The most common locations for falls are doorways, ramps, uneven surfaces, ladders, stairs, and any place prone to wetness or spills. Armed with the knowledge of your most dangerous areas, you can use good housekeeping best practices and safety stair treads to stop falls before they happen.\nWe have a variety of non-slip products to meet your facility’s specific needs.\n- Non-Slip Tapes and Treads — Perfect for indoor or outdoor use, these tapes have an anti-slip grit surface for traction and can be easily applied with peel-and-stick adhesive backing. They come in a variety of colors, widths, and slogans and can be used on steps, ladders, inclines, ramps, or surfaces that are often wet. We even carry a line of extreme tapes for harsh environments.\n- Fiberglass Stair Treads — For use at the primary point of contact on stairs or landings for maximum pedestrian safety, the strong, mineral-abrasive epoxy grit coating is cost-effective and can be used on wood, concrete, or metal.\n- Aluminum Stair Nosings and Treads — For use on worn steps, new construction, or renovations, these treads are strong enough for industrial use but attractive enough to be used residentially. They are available in seven standard colors, made from corrosive-resistant extruded aluminum, and utilize a blend of abrasive grit and epoxy filler for a superstrong non-slip surface.\nAll of our anti-slip treads are easy to install, allowing you to make your facility safer immediately."}

The diary, which was just discovered in 2003, was kept intermittently by the President during 1947. It is fascinating reading.\nThe entry for January 3:\nByrnes & I discussed General Marshall’s last letter and decided to ask him to come home. Byrnes is going to quit on the tenth and I shall make Marshall Sec[retary] of State. Some of the crackpots will in all probability yell their heads off-but let ‘em yell! Marshall is the ablest man in the whole gallery.\nMrs. Roosevelt came in at 3 P.M. to assure me that Jimmy & Elliott had nothing against me and intended no disparagement of me in their recent non-edited remarks. Said she was for me. Said she didn’t like Byrnes and was sure he was not reporting Elliott correctly. Said Byrnes was always for Byrnes and no one else. I wonder! He’s been loyal to me[.] In the Senate he gave me my first small appropriation, which started the Special Committee to investigate the National Defense Program on its way. He’d probably have done me a favor if he’d refused to give it.\nMaybe there was something on both sides in this situation. It is a pity a great man has to have progeny! Look at Churchill’s. Remember Lincoln’s and Grant’s. Even in collateral branches Washington’s wasn’t so good-and Teddy Roosevelt’s are terrible.\nThe entry for January 8:\nThe Senate took Marshall lock, stock and barrell [sic]. Confirmed him by unanimous consent and did not even refer his nomination to a committee. A grand start for him.\nI am very happy over that proceedure [sic]. Marshall is, I think[,] the greatest man of the World War II. He managed to get along with Roosevelt, the Congress, Churchill, the Navy and the Joint Chief of Staff and he made a grand record in China.\nWhen I asked him to take the extrovert Pat Hurley[‘]s place as my special envoy to China, he merely said “Yes, Mr. President I’ll go.” No argument only patriotic action. And if any man was entitled to balk and ask for a rest, he was. We’ll have a real State Dep[artmen]t now.\nThe entry for July 6:\nDrove an open car from Charlottesville to Washington-starting at 9:15 Washington time.\nHad a V[irgini]a Highway Policeman in a car ahead making the pace at exactly the speed allowed by V[irgini]a law. He forced all the trucks to one side as I always wanted to do. Made the drive in 3 hours. Had Sec[retary] of Treas[ury] Snyder, Adm[iral] Leahy, and Doctor Brig[adier] Gen[eral] Graham as passengers. All said they enjoyed the ride and felt they needed no extra accident coverage!\nDavid McCullough’s Truman is superb."}
{"text": "Adrian Lewis sees it as greatly expanding the toolbox.\nAn Army officer is stationed in Afghanistan and charged with running and rebuilding a small city.\nAt his disposal could be a public administration manual published on the Internet and developed by Kansas University faculty on starting up municipal services.\nThe manual could be translated into the Farsi language to help with the transition as the Army officer, who took graduate classes at KU while stationed at Fort Leavenworth, can put into practice what he learned in Kansas to help people around the world.\n“What we’re doing is good for the country. It has major implications,” said Lewis, director of KU’s Office of Military Graduate Education.\nLewis is a leader in one of the university’s major initiatives in its relationship with the military, mainly Fort Leavenworth, home to the Army’s Command and General Staff College. KU’s ties to the military have gained steam over the last few years, and it became one of former Chancellor Robert Hemenway’s legacies in the final years of tenure leading KU.\n“It’s not a one-way street in either direction. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship,” said Lewis, who also is a KU history professor and retired Army major.\nThe university’s partnership with Fort Leavenworth covers a broad spectrum, from faculty teaching Special Forces officers to journalism students helping Army officers with mock press conferences to wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan pursuing graduate degrees at KU.\nThe 2009-2010 academic year promises to be another busy one in this working partnership.\nFrom indirect fire, shrapnel pierced Wes Fine’s face and upper body when he served in Iraq during 2005.\nThe Army captain worked to recover, but eventually doctors had to remove his left eye. After he was injured Fine (pronounced Fi-nay) had a hard time adjusting the civilian life.\nHe had already earned a bachelor’s degree in justice administration, but when he returned home to Hawaii, Fine had a difficult time finding a job. He wanted to be a police officer or a prison guard, but due to his injuries, he couldn’t get very far in the job application process.\n“It is not only demoralizing, gosh, it’s really depressing, especially when you were in charge of a lot of people and you’ve done a lot of things in the Army. You come home, and you have difficulty finding employment,” said Fine, who now is 29.\nSuddenly his luck changed. Fine qualified for a new Army program, called Wounded Warriors. Wounded soldiers get their graduate studies at KU paid for by the Army, and in return, the graduates agree to take a job as a military employee for three years to every 12 months the Army pays for.\nFine is now taking classes at KU, pursuing a graduate degree in international studies. He hopes to finish his thesis in time to graduate in December. He’s on track to teach at Fort Leavenworth when he finishes his degree.\nLewis said the program has flourished at KU last year, as Fine and six other Wounded Warriors were participating. The Army also wanted to expand the program to include five more soldiers this year.\n“I just feel like I’ve gotten lucky. This is the best program I think out there the Army has,” Fine said. “It’s a great privilege. Everything is pretty much taken care of.”\nKU’s partnership with the Army and Fort Leavenworth expands beyond the Wounded Warriors program.\nSince 2003, leaders at KU and Fort Leavenworth have held discussions and worked toward an agreement on an educational partnership, where Army students learn from KU faculty members.\n“They benefit from what we have to offer. We benefit from the broadened view they can provide us,” said Barbara Romzek, the associate dean for social and behavioral sciences at KU’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\nLewis, who came to KU from the University of North Texas, said the partnership differs from stereotypes about the military not being welcome amid student protests, especially during the Vietnam era.\nGenerally, people who work at KU and live in Kansas are more supportive of the military, he said. The state has two Army military bases at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley, plus the McConnell Air Force base near Wichita.\n“Most of the time (faculty members) are very willing to work with the military,” Lewis said.\nKU faculty members have a history teaching Fort Leavenworth soldiers, and the relationship is becoming more prevalent. The program recently received a $2 million federal earmark that will allow KU to hire four new faculty members to be able to teach public administration, political science, business and history to Special Forces officers.\nArmy officers are having to expand their horizons to learn languages and management tactics in communities due to the challenges of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the military has had to fight insurgents and also help civilians there.\n“We have the best Army in the world when it comes to breaking things,” Lewis said. “Now they are trying to reorient where they can fix things.”\nThat’s where the Army can benefit from the tools KU can offer in its many academic departments.\nRomzek will be teaching a public administration course with Holly Goerdel, a KU assistant professor of public administration, at Fort Leavenworth this fall, and law professor John Head will teach the second half of the course.\n“The smarter they are, the better equipped they are, and the better job they are able to do,” Romzek said.\nLewis also hopes KU can expand its partnership to other branches of the military. He said the Army will see the upside of the relationship as more of its officers are sent into war-torn countries like Afghanistan to try and rebuild communities from the ground up.\n“That’s where KU comes in,” Lewis said."}
{"text": "Safe, effective and easily available home remedy for pyorrhea. Best Remedies for Pus in gums from accredited sources with no side reactions.\nPyorrhea is a very common periodontal disease that affects gums surrounding the roots of the teeth. It leads to inflammation, irritation and pus in gums further resulting in loosening of teeth. Pyorrhea is the primary cause for tooth loss in adults.\nCauses of Pyorrhea:\nPyorrhea is caused by bacterial infection.\nFood particles get stuck in crevices between teeth. When teeth are not brushed properly and regularly, bacteria build up on teeth plaque. Bacteria convert these food particles especially the sugar into acids. These acidic elements putrefy the gums and teeth and induce Pyorrhea like conditions.\nOther common causes of Pyorrhea include external injury of teeth and gums, improper use of toothpick and incorrect brushing.\nSymptoms of Pyorrhea:\n- Pus oozing from margins of teeth\n- Swollen and inflamed gums\n- Loosened teeth roots.\n- Sepsis of digestive tract or liver disorders, if pus persists for a longer time.\nHome Remedy for Pus in Gums (Pyorrhea)\nGuava: Unripe guava is rich in Vitamin C and is a styptic agent. Chewing raw guava arrests formation of pus in gums and is an excellent home remedy for Pyorrhea. Chewing tender leaves of guava is also beneficial in treatment of Pyorrhea. Mouthwash made of decoction of guava tree bark helps stop bleeding and discharge of pus in gums.\nLemon: Lemon is rich in Vitamin C. Lemon strengthens teeth and helps in preventing inflammation of gums. Regular use of lemon is an excellent home remedy for Pyorrhea.\nCarrot and Spinach juice: Juice of raw spinach mixed with equal amount of carrot juice is very effective home cure for Pyorrhea and several other teeth related disorders like bleeding of gums.\nOnion: Onion has a potent bactericidal property which helps fight gum bleeding. Chewing raw onion for a few minutes kills all germs and is an excellent home cure for Pyorrhea.\nOrange:Orange is rich in Vitamin C and helps keep teeth and gums healthy. Skin of orange rubbed on teeth and gums is also beneficial in the treatment of Pyorrhea.\nLettuce: Leaf of lettuce vegetable should be chewed before every meal. This is very effecting in preventing and curing Pyorrhea.\nPepper: Pepper powder with salt is an excellent dentifrice to deal with dental problems like caries, plaque, sensitive teeth, bleeding gums and is a recommended home remedy for Pyorrhea.\nWheat: Chewing wheat soaked in water for around 10 minutes, is very effective exercise for teeth and gums and helps in improving blood circulation in the area. This is beneficial in treatment of Pyorrhea and related problems like bleeding and pus in gums.\nPomegranate grind: Powder of pomegranate rind mixed with common salt and pepper is an excellent dentifrice which helps counter bacterial infection by cleaning teeth and gums of plaque and tartar.\nMarjoram (Botanical name: Origanum majorana): Marjoram oil extract applied twice a day on the gums is very effective in arresting pus in gums.\nHoly basil (Botanical name: OcimumSanctum): Dried and powdered holybasil leaves mixed with mustard oil is rubbed on tooth and gums. This is an excellent home remedy for pus in gums, pyorrhea, gum bleeding and toothache.\nBabul (Botanical name: Acacia Arabica): Chewing of fresh bark helps arrest bleeding gums and is an effective home remedy for Pyorrhea. Paste of babul wood charcoal, rock salt and roasted alum mixed in 5:1:1 ratio is an effective home cure for Pyorrhea.\nAll teeth related disorders revolve around unhealthy heating habits. What to eat and when to eat are equally important questions to be addressed for maintaining healthy gums and teeth.\nIntake of food rich in Vitamin C is vital for curing swollen or bleeding gums. Lime, grapes, oranges, pineapple, guava and lowly myrobalan provide rich source of vitamin C.\nOther food which help cure Pyorrhea include milk, unpolished rice, Wheat products\n(not passed through sieve) and vegetables like carrots, cucumber and spinach.\nFoods to avoid: Products made from refined sugar.\n- Munch a piece of guava, apple, radish or cucumber after your meals. This acts as natural teeth brushing.\n- use of toothpick should be avoided. Silk thread can instead be used to clean spaces between teeth, if required."}
{"text": "A “Small” Plastic Waste Problem\nWhy Are Plastics Not Biodegradable?\nBiodegradable substances can be broken down by microorganisms at a molecular level. Since the chemical bonds found in non-biodegradable plastics don’t occur in nature, microorganisms are unable to break them down1. As they don’t biodegrade, they continually break down into smaller pieces through a process called elemental exposure. The average time for plastics to break down via elemental exposure is around 450 years2, and this is why plastic waste is a problem. Once they break down into to pieces smaller than 5 mm they are known as ‘microplastics’.\nWhere Do They Come From?\nMicroplastics come from two sources: the breakdown of plastic waste and industrially manufactured microbeads. Plastics in the marine environment are exposed to UV radiation, cycles of wetting and drying and microorganisms. Prolonged exposure to these physical, chemical and biological processes cause the plastics to become brittle. The weakened plastic will produce microplastic sized chips and flakes as the weather bends and flexes it.\nIndustrially-produced microbeads, used in many cosmetic products, pose as big a problem as microplastics made via environmental breakdown. Microbeads, being a cheaper alternative, have replaced many of the natural abrasives such as salts, bamboo, and nut shells. Microbeads are smoother, less effective exfoliators, which have been claimed to be used to sell more products. Cosmetic microbeads are washed down the drain and into the open water, as the filters in water treatment facilities have proven incapable of catching them3. Once in open water, their effect on the environment is not limited to ruining the aesthetics of beaches and sea views. The danger lies in their ability to accumulate harmful and toxic chemicals, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs).\nWhat Are POPs & Why Are They A Problem?\nPOP is a collective term for chemicals (characterised by their resistance to photolytic, biological and chemical degradation) that make it into the environment4. POPs primarily come from the runoff of pesticides, industrial chemicals and their by-products5. As POPs resist degradation, they can accumulate in the oceans and are attracted to the surfaces of microplastics6.\nOn the surface this may not seem like a problem but studies have shown that corals, zooplankton and crustaceans789 are unable to distinguish between actual food and microplastics. Since these animals are part of the global food web, microplastics, and the POPs on their surface, can accumulate in large concentrations in fish, blocking their gills and digestive tract and allowing POPs to accumulate in their fatty tissues10.\nWhat Is Being Done About It?\nAround 63% of plastic waste comes from packaging. Other sources of plastic waste such as automotive, construction and agricultural industries, as well as households contribute to the problem, but their input is small in comparison to the problem of plastic packaging11. Despite packaging being the biggest contributor to the amount of plastic waste, it has been cosmetic microbeads that have received recent attention. There has been great pressure from environmental charities and lobbyists urging government and industry to ban the use of microbeads in cosmetics.\nThe good news is that these actions are paying off. Although no government has placed an outright ban on using microbeads, Canada is moving towards it (having reviewed over 130 scientific papers) and a consensus from both parties that legislation is required12. The Australian government have already taken strong action and banned the supply of lightweight plastic bags with the states of New South Wales and South Australia, having agreed to phase out microbeads13. In Europe it was the Dutch Minister of Environment, Jacqueline Cramer, who set the ball rolling, calling for the European Union to ban microbeads. Following this, earlier this year, the European Commission launched a study to determine whether EU regulation is needed14. Furthermore, as of March this year, the UK government has published a report assessing the impact of microplastics exposure in fish, therefore assessing the environmental and commercial impact on fish15.\nGovernments around the world are beginning to take notice of the microplastic issue. Many have already taken steps to better manage macro-sized plastic waste. From councils implementing separate recycle bins to companies using recycled materials in their products. In 2013, a total of 464,433 tonnes of plastic waste was collected and over the past 20 years nearly 50 billion bottles were saved from the landfill16. It is hard to say how much of this was actually recycled but it is a step in the right direction.\nWith legislation on the use of microbeads hopefully on its way, the cosmetic industry has sensed the changing winds and have begun removing microplastics from their products. Whether large multinational corporations such as Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, L’Oréal, Procter and Gamble and Asda (who have begun removing them thus far)17 return to a natural, or entirely new, alternative remains to be seen.\nWhat Can Still Be Done?\nMicroplastics are a global issue, meaning there is not a single solution. It will require everyone: from the individual, to corporations, to governments to make changes in the way we use and dispose of plastics. Pressure from groups like the Plastic Soup Foundation, Fauna & Flora International and the Marine Conservation Society have helped bring the issue of microbeads to the attention of the public and government. It is now likely that microbeads will be removed from cosmetic products and legislation put in place to restrict their use.\nThere are other things that can be done to help. The first, and most obvious, thing we can all do is to recycle our plastic waste. Clothes that are made from synthetic fibres like polyester produce microfibres in the wash, washing these garments less often will reduce the amount of microfibres they release into the environment18. Until all cosmetic products are free from microplastic, we should try and limit our use of these products. To help with this, the Plastic Soup Foundation & Stichting De Noordzee have produced a free mobile app that allows the user to check whether a particular product contains microbeads. For the app and for more information about microbeads, check out beatthemicrobead.org.\nHowever, there needs to be a greater effort made to improve the ways in which we recycle. This comes down to improving education about the issue at all levels, from citizen to government. At the moment, recycling schemes vary from council to council, as the budgets and resources vary between regions. In an ideal world there would be a standardised recycling scheme. This scheme would reduce confusion about what can and can’t be recycled, as well as allowing industry to better design packaging with this strategy in mind. With the oceans collecting our plastic waste, there needs to be more done to clean up the marine environment. Examples of this could be through volunteering schemes, government initiatives or corporate publicity. Microplastics and the general issue of plastic waste is something we all contribute to. Unless we work together, the problem can, and will, only get worse.\n- Natalie Wolchover, livescience. Why Doesn’t Plastic Biodegrade? (accessed 25th August 2015)\n- Kari O’Connor, postconsumers.

{"text": "UPDATE: Written Declaration 29 was finally \">adopted by 371 members of the European Parliament. The Declaration's author backpedaled on data retention for search engines, with a disjointed explanation that it is possible to have limited — and simultaneously blanket — search engine surveillance. Unsurprisingly, members of Parliament are still confused. Stay tuned for more on the fate of data retention in Europe.\nA controversial, surreptitious proposal to compel search engines to store everything that European citizens search for on the Internet has been introduced by a few members of the European Parliament. The veiled mandatory data retention proposal was sneaked into a broader declaration called \"Written Declaration 29,\" which ostensibly seeks to promote the protection of children by developing an early warning system (EWS) to fight against pedophiles and sex offenders. But hidden within the text of the Declaration is obscure language mandating the storing of searches on a massive scale:\nAsk the [European] Council and the [European] Commission to implement Directive 2006/24/EC and extend it to search engines in order to tackle online child pornography and sex offending rapidly and effectively.\nThe Directive 2006/24/EC, more widely known as the European Data Retention Directive, is an unpopular framework that compels telecommunications service providers operating in Europe to store all communications traffic data between six months and up to 2 years, for possible use by law enforcement. European Privacy officials had previously stated that \"search queries themselves would be considered content rather than traffic data and the Directive would therefore not justify their retention.\" But in spite of that advice, Written Declaration 29 seeks to extend data retention to search engines.\nThe campaign promoting Written Declaration 29 focuses only on the goal of protecting children online, and is otherwise silent on the extension of the Data Retention Directive to search engines. The successful hiding of this controversial provision is likely what led 324 European Parliamentarians to sign the Declaration, coming close to the member signatures that it would take for the Written Declaration to be adopted. Once adopted, members of the European Parliament can use written declarations to launch or relaunch a debate on a subject that comes within the EU’s remit.\nBut when Cecilia Wikström, a member of the European Parliament, learned that the Declaration, in fact, seeks to violate EU citizens' search privacy by extending the Data Retention Directive to search engines; she publicly withdrew her support, and boldly spoke out against the proposal, seeking to clarify any possible misunderstandings for her colleagues:\nBoth of the two e-mails sent to [Members of the European Parliament] focused on the early warning system and neither mentioned the Data Retention Directive. The website set up to support the written declaration also does not mention Data Retention, at least not in an obvious way. Even the written declaration itself does not mention the Directive by name, but only refers to its reference number.\nParliamentarian Wikström also said:\nThe Written Declaration is supposed to be about an early-warning system for the protection of children. Long-term storage of citizens’ data has clearly nothing to do with 'early warning' for any purpose. The 'data preservation' system established by the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention was designed specifically for cases requiring urgent preservation of data in relation to ongoing investigations.\nWritten Declaration 29 is well-intended, however, the blanket surveillance proposal completely undermines the campaign to protect children. No measures should be implemented that cause damage to other human rights. If you live in the EU and want to help prevent search engine surveillance, visit the AKVorrat campaign page for instructions on how to contact your member of the European Parliament."}

{"text": "Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is one of several terms to describe a painful, progressive flatfoot deformity in adults. Other terms include posterior tibial tendon insufficiency and adult acquired flatfoot.\nThe term adult acquired flatfoot is more appropriate because it allows a broader recognition of causative factors, not only limited to the posterior tibial tendon, an event where the posterior tibial tendon looses strength and function.\nThe adult acquired flatfoot is a progressive, symptomatic (painful) deformity resulting from gradual stretch (attenuation) of the tibialis posterior tendon as well as the ligaments that support the arch of the foot.\nMost flat feet are not painful, particularly those flat feet seen in children. In the adult acquired flatfoot, pain occurs because soft tissues (tendons and ligaments) have been torn. The deformity progresses or worsens because once the vital ligaments and posterior tibial tendon are lost, nothing can take their place to hold up the arch of the foot.\nThe painful, progressive adult acquired flatfoot affects women four times as frequently as men. It occurs in middle to older age people with a mean age of 60 years. Most people who develop the condition already have flat feet. A change occurs in one foot where the arch begins to flatten more than before, with pain and swelling developing on the inside of the ankle. Why this event occurs in some people (female more than male) and only in one foot remains poorly understood. Contributing factors increasing the risk of adult acquired flatfoot are diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.\nThe following scheme of events is thought to cause the adult acquired flatfoot:\nA person with flat feet has greater load placed on the posterior tibial tendon which is the main tendon unit supporting up the arch of the foot. Throughout life, aging leads to decreased strength of muscles, tendons and ligaments. The blood supply diminishes to tendons with aging as arteries narrow. Heavier, obese patients have more weight on the arch and have greater narrowing of arteries due to atherosclerosis. In some people, the posterior tibial tendon finally gives out or tears. This is not a sudden event in most cases. Rather, it is a slow, gradual stretching followed by inflammation and degeneration of the tendon. Once the posterior tibial tendon stretches, the ligaments of the arch stretch and tear. The bones of the arch then move out of position with body weight pressing down from above. The foot rotates inward at the ankle in a movement called pronation. The arch appears collapsed, and the heel bone is tilted to the inside. The deformity can progress until the foot literally dislocates outward from under the ankle joint.\nThere are three stages of the adult acquired flatfoot:\n|Stage I: ||Inflammation and swelling of the posterior tibial tendon around the inside of the ankle. |\n|Stage II: ||Visible deformity comparing one foot to the other, as the symptomatic foot becomes flatter and more deformed. The deformity is movable and correctable in this stage. |\n|Stage III: ||The foot progresses to a rigid, non-movable flat foot deformity that is painful, primarily on the outside of the ankle |\nThe adult acquired flatfoot, secondary to posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, is diagnosed in a number of ways with no single test proven to be totally reliable.\nThe most accurate diagnosis is made by a skilled clinician utilizing observation and hands on evaluation of the foot and ankle. Observation of the foot in a walking examination is most reliable. The affected foot appears more pronated and deformed compared to the unaffected foot. Muscle testing will show a strength deficit. An easy test to perform in the office is the single foot raise.\nA patient is asked to step with full body weight on the symptomatic foot, keeping the unaffected foot off the ground. The patient is then instructed to \"raise up on the tip toes\" of the affected foot. If the posterior tibial tendon has been attenuated or ruptured, the patient will be unable to lift the heel off the floor and rise onto the toes. In less severe cases, the patient will be able to rise on the toes, but the heel will not be noted to invert as it normally does when we rise onto the toes.\nX-rays can be helpful but are not diagnostic of the adult acquired flatfoot. Both feet - the symptomatic and asymptomatic - will demonstrate a flatfoot deformity on x-ray. Careful observation may show a greater severity of deformity on the affected side.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can show tendon injury and inflammation but cannot be relied on with 100% accuracy and confidence. The technique and skill of the radiologist in properly positioning the foot with the MRI beam are critical in demonstrating the sometimes obscure findings of tendon injury around the ankle. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is expensive and is not necessary in most cases to diagnose posterior tibial tendon injury. Ultrasound has also been used in some cases to diagnose tendon injury, but this test again is usually not required to make the initial diagnosis.\nThe adult acquired flatfoot is best treated early. There is no recommended home treatment other than the general avoidance of prolonged weightbearing in non-supportive footwear until the patient can be seen in the office of the foot and ankle specialist.\nIn Stage I, the inflammation and tendon injury will respond to rest, protected ambulation in a cast, as well as anti-inflammatory therapy. Follow-up treatment with custom-molded foot orthoses and properly designed athletic or orthopedic footwear are critical to maintain stability of the foot and ankle after initial symptoms have been calmed.\nOnce the tendon has been stretched, the foot will become deformed and visibly rolled into a pronated position at the ankle. Non-surgical treatment has a significantly lower chance of success. Total immobilization in a cast or Camwalker may calm down symptoms and arrest progression of the deformity in a smaller percentage of patients. Usually, long-term use of a brace known as an ankle foot orthosis is required to stop progression of the deformity without surgery.\nA new ankle foot orthosis known as the Richie Brace, is available from a number of podiatric labs (www.Richiebrace.com), has proven to show significant success in treating Stage II posterior tibial dysfunction and the adult acquired flatfoot. This is a sport-style brace connected to a custom corrected foot orthotic device that fits well into most forms of lace-up footwear, including athletic shoes. The brace is light weight and far more cosmetically appealing than the traditional ankle foot orthosis previously prescribed.\nIn cases where cast immobilization, orthoses and shoe therapy have failed, surgery is the next alternative. The goal of surgery and non-surgical treatment is to eliminate pain, stop progression of the deformity and improve mobility of the patient. Opinions vary as to the best surgical treatment for adult acquired flatfoot. Procedures commonly used to correct the condition include tendon debridement, tendon transfers, osteotomies (cutting and repositioning of bone) and joint fusions. (See surgical correction of adult acquired flatfoot)\nPatients with adult acquired flatfoot are advised to discuss thoroughly the benefits vs. risks of all surgical options. Most procedures have long-term recovery mandating that the correct procedure be utilized to give the best long-term benefit. Most flatfoot surgical procedures require six to twelve weeks of cast immobilization. Joint fusion procedures require eight weeks of non-weightbearing on the operated foot - meaning you will be on crutches for two months.\nThe bottom line is: Make sure all of your non-surgical options have been covered before considering surgery. Your primary goals with any treatment are to eliminate pain and improve mobility. In many cases, with the properly designed foot orthosis or ankle brace, these goals can be achieved without surgical intervention.\nThe articles and content contained in this website are the exclusive property of PodiatryNetwork.com and PhysicianWebPages.com.

{"text": "When you picture who typically files for bankruptcy, you may envision people in their 20’s who spent recklessly or people in middle age who suffered job loss or high medical bills that made their debt soar out of control. Likely the last image in your mind is senior citizens, but surprisingly, they “are the fastest-growing segment of the population seeking bankruptcy protection, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan Law School” (USA Today). If you are a senior considering bankruptcy or your parents are,other than hiring a bankruptcy attorney, there are several things you must know.\nWhat You Will Retain in a Bankruptcy Settlement\nYou may imagine seniors as penniless and homeless after filing for bankruptcy, but that is not the case. The seniors will retain several assets that can help them live comfortably for their remaining retirement years.\nRetirement Funds: Seniors who file bankruptcy are allowed to keep up to $1.1 million in their retirement vehicles including their 401(k)s and other retirement funds.\nSocial Security: Social Security will not be affected, and even before a senior files for bankruptcy, that money cannot be garnished.\nHome: In many cases the senior will be allowed to keep their home. Under homestead exemption laws, a senior will be able to retain a certain dollar amount in her home, but this varies by state. For instance, if the senior’s home is worth $400,000, and her state’s homestead exemption law allows $200,000, she will be able to keep $200,00 in equity, but the creditors get the other $200,000. A good state to reside in is Florida, which allows a senior to keep all of the equity in her home, no matter the home’s value.\nWhat Will Be Dismissed in Bankruptcy\nSeniors will erase all unsecured debt including credit cards and medical bills when filing for bankruptcy.\nConsidering that seniors are typically living on a very limited budget, dismissing unsecured debt can protect them from harassing creditors as well as give them a fresh start to live within their means now that they no longer have to pay so much to creditors.\nOther Useful Information to Consider\nSeniors often wait longer than they should to file bankruptcy ( If you are in San Diego, you can visit San Diego bankruptcy) and use up a large portion of their retirement trying to pay down debt. Not hiding your debt, as difficult as it may be, is often the first step to regaining economic control. Also, speak with a professional early, as soon as you realize you may not be able to afford to pay back all of your debt.\nAlso, Social Security cannot be garnished, but some seniors have judgments against them allowing the creditors to access their bank accounts to obtain money, and the creditors cannot distinguish between what is Social Security money and what is not. According to Teisha Powell, a Fort Lauderdale, FL attorney, “Seniors should keep Social Security money in a separate account, and they should notify creditors in writing that the account contains only Social Security money” (Bankrate).\nWhile filing for bankruptcy may seem shameful, for some seniors on a limited income facing high medical expenses, it may be the best way to stretch their retirement for their remaining years. If a senior does find himself in this position, it is important to consider filing before creditors have access to his bank accounts."}

You shouldn't see any decay or shriveled spots. The netting should be bold and strong. Also, look at the stem end. There should be a “full slip” with no stem. That means the melon was ripe when picked and “fully slipped” off the vine instead of being cut off.\nNext is feel. The melon should feel very heavy for its size, which is a sign of great juice and sugar content. Give it a gentle squeeze. It should be firm, not spongy.\nNext: listen. Give the melon a gentle shake near your ear. If you hear any sloshing, the seed cavity is separating, a sign of age or heat abuse.\nFinally, smell a cantaloupe. It's part of the muskmelon family. Musk means “strong aroma.” If the cantaloupe smells great, it'll taste great.\nMost cantaloupe are being harvested from one of the largest melon growing regions in the world, the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.

{"text": "by Mark Philippi, from Peakhealth.com\nThe deadlift is an exercise that has unfairly received a bad reputation with the general population. Very seldom does someone ask you how much you can deadlift. It is rarely taught to clientele in the health club setting and most gyms seldom have a platform area designated for deadlifting. The deadlift has been performed mostly by powerlifters, hard core garage lifters, and bodybuilders looking to venture into the strength arena.\nThe average public perceives deadlifting with similar false stigmas to that of squatting. Squatting will hurt my knees; deadlifting will hurt my back. Both myths have taken hold due to bad technique and poor form when performing the lifts. There are few poor lifts, only poor lifting technique.\nIn reality, most everyone who is interested in weight training should perform the deadlift. A weak back makes us more susceptible to injury on a daily basis. How many times do you bend to lift objects during the average day? Most spinal specialists would agree that if you examined the backs of middle aged Americans, you would probably find an accumulation of spinal problems through the course of one's lifetime. I would also venture to say a large percentage of workman's compensation claims are filed because of back injuries. Prevention lies in strengthening the back. The deadlift is the best exercise for total back strengthening; its focus is the body's core - legs, hips, and back. It is also the best test of total body absolute strength, much more than the bench press or squat. The deadlift is also one of the best exercises to add total body mass. Individuals wanting to add mass should seriously consider about adding the deadlift to your workout program. The deadlift \"thickens\" the body.\nThere is more to performing the deadlift than walking up to a bar and picking it up. It is not as technically complex as a clean or snatch, and every bit as problematic as the squat. There are two standard styles of deadlifting: conventional - feet narrower than shoulders, and sumo - feet wider than shoulders. The style that fits most people comfortably is the conventional. It also has more carryover to daily activity.\nLet's start with foot placement. Feet should be placed at armpit width with toes slightly out. Shins will be placed next to the bar. The majority of the bodyweight should begin on the balls of the feet with a transfer to the heels through lockout. The hands should grasp the bar with an over / under grip with the arms outside the knees. The legs should be bent to the \"power position\"; approximately 60 degrees from vertical with the hips lower than the shoulders. Your head should be looking forward in a neutral position. The chest should be forward, not down. Shoulders should be squeezed tightly back and positioned directly over the bar. Do not round the shoulders, as more force will then be applied to the back.\nBeginning the Lift\nThe deadlift when executed correctly is a push from the floor followed by a pull to a locked out position. The force distribution on the feet places the force on the balls of the feet during the initial push off the ground followed by a transfer to the heel as the bar passes the knees and into lockout. As the bar breaks the ground, the hips must be in the power position although before starting the lift, they can be anywhere that is comfortable. This means there must be a focus on bending the knees and using the legs to drive. Do not let the legs lock out prematurely thereby placing more strain on the back. Always keep the chest above the hips. The bar should just brush the shins when leaving the ground. Try to accelerate the bar from the ground. The faster the bar moves past the knees, the easier the lockout. As the bar passes the knees, drive the head back helping your hip lockout as well. Do not hyperextend the back at lockout. Upon completion of the deadlift, return the bar to the platform slowly and under control. Do not slam the weights off the ground. Be in good position to start another rep, maintaining tightness throughout the body. Pause before starting the next rep, allow the reps to be momentum free. Do not bounce off of the ground.\nThe deadlift can be used to develop work capacity, build mass, or increase strength. I believe for most people, keeping routines basic is the best way. I believe heavy deadlifting once per week is sufficient for developing strength. If a second workout per week is desired, it should be kept lighter, concentrating on form, technique, and speed of movement.\nInitially it is important to develop work capacity. This will facilitate quicker recovery in your workouts. This means utilizing 3 to 5 sets of 8 to 10 reps, weights approximately 50 to 65% of 1rm, and relatively short rest periods of no more than 90 to 120 seconds. If technique breaks down during a set, stop and add another set; ie. 4 sets of 10 reps = 40 total reps, go to 5 sets of 8 reps. The work output remains the same.\nAfter work capacity is developed, strength and mass development can take place. I suggest using 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 6 reps, weights approximately 70 to 90% of 1rm. Rest periods can be longer, between 2 and 4 minutes, to facilitate further recovery. Again, if technique breaks down; shorten the set and add another to the workout.\nIf pure absolute strength is desired, you can add a peaking phase to your routine. Use 1 to 3 sets of singles and doubles between 90 to 100% of 1rm with full recovery between sets. For recovery and overtraining purposes, limit peaking phase to 3 to 4 weeks consecutively.\nIn the classical periodization model, as the intensity increases, the total work volume decreases. Therefore, volume or \"down\" sets can be added to keep work capacity high and maintain the training effect.\nSAMPLE DEADLIFT PROGRAM\nThe following is a 10 week sample deadlift program that takes in effect all aspects of the previously mentioned categories: work capacity, strength / mass building, and absolute strength development. It also utilizes drop sets to increase the volume of the workout to keep the training effect. The routine does not include warm up sets.\nWeek Phase Sets/Reps Rest Interval\n1 Work Capacity 10*3 Sets @ 55% 60 Seconds\n2 Work Capacity 8*3 Sets @ 65% 60 Seconds\n3 Strength Phase 5*3 Sets @ 75% 3 minutes\n4 Strength Phase 5*3 Sets @ 80% 3 minutes\n5 Strength Phase 3*3 Sets @ 83%, 8*1 Set @ 70% 3 minutes\n6 Strenght Phase 3*3 Sets @ 86%, 8*1 Set @ 70% 3 minutes\n7 Strength Phase 2*3 Sets @ 89%, 6*1 Set @ 75% 3 minutes\n8 Peaking Phase 2*2 Sets @ 92%, 6*1 Set @ 75% 3-5 minutes\n9 Peaking Phase 2*2 Sets @ 95%, 5*1 Set @ 80% 3-5 minutes\n10 Peaking Phase 1*2 Sets @ 98%, 5*1 Set @ 80% 3-5 minutes\n11 Peaking Phase Test or Competition\nIn closing, the deadlift should be an important part of everyone's workout regimen; it is not just for powerlifters. It strengthens the core of the body; that to which all other parts are connected. Therefore, it is useless to have a big chest and huge pipes if you have a weak back giving you trouble. If properly performed the deadlift is a very safe and effective way to build work capacity, strength and mass. I would recommend that anyone interested in increasing total body strength add the deadlift to his or her workout.\nAbout the Author:\nMark Philippi, CSCS is currently the head strength coach at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.

{"text": "Sheepshead fishing is fun anytime because sheepshead is an example of a fish species that can be caught year round along all southern coastal areas. A brackish to saltwater species, they are called sheepshead because they have a month full of choppers that more closely resemble those possessed by the mammal than those of a fish. These choppers enable them to feed on one of nature’s most durable critters: barnacles. The habitat of the sheepshead is always in or around barnacle encrusted structures such as bridge piling, large rock formation like jetties, or submerged chunks of concrete rubble. So, when sheepshead fishing an angler must fish these types of structures.\nHowever, the best bait for sheepshead fishing is the fiddler crab. Plus, in keeping with our theme of “do it yourself”, fiddlers can be caught around most coastal marshes, creeks, and ditches. At lower tides, fiddler crab are generally quite abundant, running around looking for their next meal. Most anglers catch them by hand or with some type of small mesh dip net and place them in a bucket. Fiddler crabs are easy to keep alive, they should be damp but do not submerge them in water. Protect the fiddlers for the heat and break off the large oversized claw when ready to use.\nIf sheedshead fishing from a bridge or pier, get as close to the structure as you can, then let the fiddler drift by. Set the hook quickly and hope the sheepshead does not wrapped himself around the structure. The heavy leader line may provide some protection against the barnacle but after the catch is hauled in, be sure and inspect the leader for abrasion then replace if needed. Sheepshead will normal not bite minnows or mullet, and artificial lures do not appeal to them so why waste the time. Also, sheepshead are a regulated fishery so check your local fishing regulation handbook for limits.\nHere’s a tip, try blacken sheepshead fillets. You will need a cast iron flat pan which can be heated to a high temperature, a cooking burner (outdoors because this does create some smoke), unsalted real butter, a bottle of blacken fish seasoning and follow the direction on the bottle from there. You will be shocked just how good this is!\nNow check out this article by Daniel Hagen for more on \"how to catch sheepshead\" then go catch you some."}
{"text": "|Send to printer »|\nFeature Articles : Jun 15, 2006 ( )\nBiomanufacturing for Regenerative Medicine\nTissue Engineering and Cell-based Therapies Go Beyond the Therapeutic Reach of a Pill!--h2>\nRecent advances in cell therapies and tissue engineering are paving the road to regenerative medicine. The goals of this emerging field are to replace, repair, or regenerate tissues and organs.\nThe underpinnings for this process are found in the biomanufacturing requirements for stem cells and engineered tissue. Each must deal with a growing body of complex issues that include cost containment and the need for deriving products under GMP. Other challenges include scale-up of manufacturing processes and use of appropriate tissue scaffolds and bioreactors for the creation of 3-D models.\n\"Broadly speaking,\" states Thomas B. Okarma, Ph.D., M.D., president, CEO, and director of Geron (www.geron.com), \"the cost of goods is among the most critical issues for biomanufacturing cellular therapies. Our ethics advisory board spent six years studying these issues, and their major concern was that the product must be able to be delivered at a low cost.\n\"For example, when companies use primary adult stem cells, costs can be huge. That is an individualized therapy with different product specs for each isolated cell product. That type of cell is much harder to regulate and more costly to produce.\"\nGeron focuses on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). \"The use of hESCs eliminates donor variability. The hESC technology provides a product-based business model with scalable manufacturing rigor that is unprecedented over the past 30-40 years of cell therapy manufacturing.\n\"Cell therapy goes way beyond the therapeutic reach of a pill, and we will see cost containment in this field for the first time. hESCs provide the platform to fill all requirements of scalable GLP and GMP manufacturing,\" points out Dr. Okarma.\nThe company is developing cell-based therapies for several diseases, based upon differentiated cells, derived from hESCs. \"Our company has a GMP master cell bank, a highly characterized collection of hESCs from which to begin manufacturing. We have developed proprietary methods for growing, maintaining, and scale-up of undifferentiated hESCs using feeder cell-free conditions and a chemically defined culture medium,\" continues Dr. Okarma.\nHe points out that a key to success for using hESCs is adapting them to culture without feeder cells or serum-containing media. \"This eliminates concerns about viral or animal protein contamination. Manufacturing hESCs in this way enables us to control the manufacturing process like any other biological drug.\"\nSome current methods generate embryonic stem cells using a fertilized egg. Stem cells are taken from the inner cell mass of a five-day old blastocyst, destroying the developing embryo.\nAdvanced Cell Technology (www.advancedcell.com) is pioneering a new method in which stem cells are removed without destroying the embryo. In this technique, a blastomere is removed at the eight-cell stage. The blastomere is cultured with an established embryonic stem cell line and subsequently separated to form new cell lines. The embryonic blastocyst is left intact and can be implanted into the uterus.\nThe company recently validated their first GMP laboratory in its facility in Worcester, MA. They are focusing on the derivation and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells under GMP conditions.\n\"There are a number of issues to be dealt with not only in GMP but beyond that, when one enters human safety and efficacy trials,\" says Robert Lanza, M.D., vp research and scientific development. \"The GMPs are similar in some respects to those for any other biotherapeutic. You need appropriate process validation to trace all raw materials and document them from beginning to end. Equipment and standard operating procedures all must be validated.\n\"But for cell therapies you need to address other considerations as well. Cells must be carefully characterized to show they do not form tumors, that they don’t contain pathogens, and that the passage number is optimal for the specific use. Their growth conditions must allow them to recapitulate normal tissue.\"\nDr. Lanza emphasizes that it is critical that the cells are carefully characterized before safety and efficacy trials in patients are initiated. \"For example, you need to define all your protocols, including your differentiation system, your inclusion/ exclusion criteria, and which passages and cell culture conditions still provide the same phenotype. You need to be able to reproducibly generate a well-defined population of cells, or the FDA may make you repeat your safety and efficacy studies all over again.\"\nAdvanced Cell is studying retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and hemangioblast cells. Their stem cell-derived RPEs target age-related diseases of the eye, such as macular degeneration, while hemangioblasts target cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.\nAntibodies to Purify Stem Cells\nStem cells also can be harvested from tissue. These are rare cells that both self-renew and produce the functional specialized cells of the organ from which they were derived. Stem Cells (www.stemcells.com) isolates human tissue-derived stem cells via immunopurification techniques, based on the antigenic signature on the cell surface. The company believes this technology has a broad therapeutic approach, similar in importance to traditional pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered biologics.\nIn this manufacturing process, specific antigens on the stem cell surface serve as tags for their isolation via Mabs. After, initially harvesting cells from human tissue, such as brain, liver, or pancreas, the company uses their library of Mabs to identify, purify, and characterize the human stem cells of interest. A sophisticated cell-sorting step removes inappropriate cells. The purified populations of stem cells then can be expanded, banked, and evaluated using in vivo and in vitro models to demonstrate that they maintain the original stem cell properties.\nFor example, their scientists transplanted normal human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNS-SC) into the brains of immunodeficient mice and found that the implanted cells differentiated into the three major CNS cell types. Thus, these cells could adapt to the host brain and behave like normal host cells in continuing to divide, migrate, and differentiate.\nLike cell therapy, tissue engineering is another fast growing biotech sector. Tissue engineering seeds cells into culture often containing a physical scaffold that helps them grow into complex, sophisticated 3-D models in vitro.\n\"Bioreactors are key to this process,\" says Steve Navran, Ph.D., CSO, Synthecon (www.synthecon.com). \"Compared to static culture methods, growing cells in bioreactors provides dynamic cell culture conditions that greatly improve growth and survival of cells, because there is a superior transfer of nutrients and gases.\"\nDr. Navran notes that the type of bioreactor used may impact the success of cell growth. \"Chemical and biomedical engineering issues must be considered. You need to preserve the basic principles to maintain the three dimensionality of the cell growth environment and not expose cells to excessive shear forces. Also the type and size of the bioreactor used affects availability of nutrients and oxygen. For example, applications may need more or less cell aggregation.\n\"Our high aspect ratio bioreactor vessels tend to promote more aggregation, while the more cylindrical perfusion vessels limit large aggregates.\"\nAnother issue is scaleup and preservation. \"Scaling up is fairly linear in the Rotary Cell Culture System, or RCCS, up to about 500 ml in a batch-fed RCCS bioreactor,\" says Dr. Navran. \"But beyond that, the best way to go is with perfusion. Perfusion RCCS bioreactor systems can go much higher, because feeding and gassing are provided externally.\"\nGoing to GMP is always envisioned and must be carefully taken into consideration, according to Dr. Navran. Sometimes it is more cost efficient to outsource. \"We have an application approaching human trial stage. We don’t maintain a clean room facility, so we will partner with an outside source. This strategy can be a cost saving measure and a more efficient way to attain cGMP.\"\nScaffolds for 3-D Cell Structure\nAlmost 20 years ago, researchers developed porous polymeric scaffolds that enabled scientists to grow tissue in thick layers. Since then, a number of functional tissue equivalents have been grown in the laboratory, including skin, cartilage, tendon, bone, and blood vessels.\nEngineered scaffolds are created from anything from loofa sponges to complexes of polymers, such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, or many other mixtures.\n\"The choice of which type of scaffold to use has an impact on how cells will look and function,\" says Richard Fry, managing director, Cellon (www.cellon.lu), \"as it is clear that form and function are closely linked in biological systems. Cells grown in normal tissue culture flasks look different than cells that grow in vivo.\n\"If you cultivate cells on two different scaffolds, they may look different. Cells produced on less rigid supports, such as hydrogel scaffolds, are less spatially constricted, particularly when grown in a rotary cell culture system. This allows them to look and potentially function in a similar way to the parental tissue.\"\nScaffold properties that researchers consider include mechanical strength, degradation time, degradation byproducts, porosity, and fiber orientation.\n\"There are many types of scaffolds. Some are standard and some need custom mixing, says Fry. \"They can come in sheets or tubes. Nonaligned scaffolds are manufactured from spun fibers using a nonwoven textile process. You can further modify the basic scaffold material to enhance cell attachment and growth or modify the physical properties and resorption rate.\"\nAnother type of scaffold is an aligned scaffold. These also are fabricated from spun fibers but are available in a variety of custom 3-D shapes and tubular structures. The main advantage of aligned scaffolds is that structures, such as tubing, are then seamless.\nIn recent years, some attention has focused on multipotential cells that give rise to various specific cell types. BioTissue Technologies (www.biotissue-tec.com) is developing multipotential cells, such as mesenchymal progenitors and periosteal cells. These cells are an attractive tissue engineering approach because they possess the ability to undergo extensive replication and develop into mesenchymal tissue, such as bone and cartilage.\nAccording to the company, challenges in this arena include developing necessary procedures for cell isolation, expansion, and preservation. It is also important to establish methods for phenotypic and functional characterization, as well as characterize how the cells differentiate in vitro.\n© 2013 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News, All Rights Reserved"}
{"text": "Will Skype stay this popular under Microsoft?\nStatistics touted in a new infographic show that usage of Skype's free calling and video services is robust. Does it justify the $8.5 billion acquisition, though?\nThe team at Skype recently published an infographic that shows the vast usage numbers associated with its free calling services.\nAccording to the infographic, based on daily stats gathered in July, Skype usage represents more than 255 billion minutes (or 4.25 billion hours) of calls annually, which is roughly four times more than the service saw in 2008.\nDespite the tremendous growth in usage, Skype may have as many detractors as it does proponents. Its services have suffered from a number of hiccups over the last few years, including a serious bout of downtime in December 2010.\nFor many users (like myself) who depend on it as a work tool on a daily basis, it's long been the service we love to hate. However, adoption has continued, and it would appear that usage has grown as well.\nAs the company,, moves , frequent users wonder how Microsoft might attempt to monetize its services. It's not yet clear how Microsoft intends to make back the $8.5 billion it spent on acquiring Skype in May.\nIn 2009, Skype had revenue of $860 million, on which it posted an operating profit of $264 million. Overall, the company made a small loss of $7 million and had long-term debt of $686 million.\nBased on some simple math, if Microsoft was justifying the $8.5 billion purchase price based on the number of people who sign in daily, they would be paying about $123 per unmonetized daily user, which is probably not too bad.\nThe infographic's stats don't specifically mention revenue, but Skype has implemented a number of features, including group video calling and group screen sharing for Mac users, that encourage people to pay for the service.\nA quick look at the daily average stats:\n- 65 million people sign into Skype daily\n- 700 million minutes of Skype-to-Skype calls made daily\n- 300 million minutes of video calls"}

Forest fires in Northern California and Oregon were responsible for two\nsignificant regional scale aerosol transport events observed in southern\nBritish Columbia during summer 2008. A combination of ground based\n(CORALNet) and satellite (CALIPSO) lidar, sunphotometry and high altitude\nchemistry observations permitted unprecedented characterization of forest\nfire plume height and mixing as well as description of optical properties\nand physicochemistry of the aerosol. In southwestern BC, lidar observations show\nthe smoke to be mixed through a layer extending to 5–6 km a.g.l. where the\naerosol was confined by an elevated inversion in both cases. Depolarization\nratios for a trans-Pacific dust event (providing a basis for comparison) and\nthe two smoke events were consistent with observations of dust and smoke\nevents elsewhere and permit discrimination of aerosol events in the region.\nBased on sunphotometry, the Aerosol Optical Thicknesses (AOT) reached maxima\nof ~0.7 and ~0.4 for the two events respectively.\nDubovik-retrieval values of reff, f during both the June/July and August\nevents varied between about 0.13 and 0.15 μm and confirm the dominance\nof accumulation mode size particles in the forest fire plumes. Both Whistler\nPeak and Mount Bachelor Observatory data show that smoke events are\naccompanied by elevated CO and O3 concentrations as well as elevated\nK+/SO4 ratios.

{"text": "Traditional census taking\nIn England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and 13 other countries in Europe, the householder receives a questionnaire in the post, completes it, and either submits it online or sends it back in the post. In other countries, such as Ireland, a large field force visits every household in the land to deliver, and then collect, census questionnaires. All the countries of Eastern Europe carry out interview censuses, where the enumerators collect and record the information on the householder’s behalf.\nAs the population grows and changes, censuses become harder to carry out. To get questionnaires out and back faster, many countries are switching from hand delivery and collection to the post. In 2011, thirteen European countries included the option to complete their census forms online.\nThough simple, the traditional approach needs to mobilise vast resources to make the census happen and encourage people to take part. Most of the action is concentrated into a matter of weeks or months, supported by a large, temporary field force. Its success depends on winning public support, which is why the 2011 Census for England and Wales was publicised through national, regional and local advertising, public and press relations, and wide local authority and public engagement.\nA rolling census takes the census in the traditional way, but to a rolling schedule, taking field counts in every municipality and neighbourhood over five years. Census results are based on moving averages worked out over the five-year cycle and updated every year. The method enables census data to be released more frequently and spreads costs and human involvement over time. France has run a rolling census since 2004.\nTwo approaches to collecting census data enable the majority of the population to complete a short form containing basic information, with more detailed information gathered by means of an annual survey or long form.\nShort form with annual survey\nEvery householder completes a short form – for the US 2010 Census it was just ten questions. A national annual survey is used to update the information and add more detail in the way of population characteristics.\nLong form and short form\nAll households and communal establishment residents have a short form to complete, while a sample of the population has a long form to collect more detail. The short form is used for the population count and to collect basic information such as usual address, sex, age and relationships to other household members.\nWhile this can widen the range of content without asking everyone to complete a long form, it may complicate field operations and limit outputs for small geographic areas. Many years from now, it could also limit the information available to family historians."}
{"text": "Media Played Pivotal Role in Empowering Women\nThursday, 07 March 2013\nAs International Women’s Day approaches, a leading expert on women’s history has reflected on the pivotal role played by the media in empowering women.\nProfessor Maggie Andrews, of the University of Worcester, said the media had, over the centuries, given women the power and the platform to become liberated.\nThe topic is explored in a new book on the interrelationship of women’s history and media history, co-edited by Professor Andrews.\n“Media has been hugely important to women in the twentieth century,” she said. “Women have drawn upon the lexicon of media images of femininity to build a sense of who they are and who they could be.\n“The introduction of the radio into the homes in the 1920s, for example, changed women’s lives. It provided leisure, education and an engagement with the wider world to many housewives. As both radio and television are domestic mediums they have given women a voice and increasingly become an important space for discussion of women’s issues and a questioning of women’s role.\n“Therefore media has played a vital role in twentieth century feminism – it would not be too much to say that it is impossible to imagine the changing role of women in the last 100 years without the important role of the media in these changes.”\nIn the chapters of Women and the Media: Feminism and Femininity in Britain, 1900 to the Present, Professor Andrews also takes a look role the media has played in the contested and changing social position of women in Britain since the Edwardian era and yet has arguably been side-lined within Women’s History.\n“The Suffragettes in the Edwardian period were very media savvy,” said Professor Andrews. “Their campaigns, marches and civil unrest were always planned to get maximum media coverage. In the 1960s and 1970s magazines like Honey and Cosmopolitan gave feminism a voice. More recently the media has provided a range of feminist role modules of the latter twentieth century such as: Cagney and Lacey in the 1980s or more recently Kate Adie and Nigella Lawson.”\nProfessor Maggie Andrews and Sallie McNamara, of Southampton Solent University, will complete the new book in June this year, which will be published and available in the New Year."}

We believe the idea for the film may have been sparked when doing research on optical illusions for a separate project, and naturally that spiraled into a cheeky ironic fictional storyline about the history of eyerolls, and soon become a DISSERTATION on how eyerolls combat violence and make the world a better place in the most epically passive-aggressive way.

{"text": "Senator Saland’s Legislation To Assist Victims Of Domestic Violence Passes The Senate\nSenator Steve Saland (R,C Poughkeepsie) today announced that the Senate has passed legislation he sponsored which would assist victims of domestic violence by establishing a criminal penalty for those who obstruct or prevent telephone calls or electronic requests for emergency assistance (S.3510) and legislation that would increase the duration of orders of protection up to eight years (S.318).\nPresent law does not expressly punish those who obstruct or prevent another person’s telephone calls or electronic requests for emergency assistance. This legislation creates a new criminal offense \"Obstructing a Telephonic or Electronic Communication for Assistance\" as a Class A Misdemeanor. The legislation includes both calls to emergency services as well as calls to anyone else who might provide assistance including a neighbor, family member, or friend.\nAlthough domestic violence has a high rate of recidivism victims may not obtain a new or extended order of protection unless the abuser has committed a new offense. Presently an order of protection may be issued for up to five years but is often issued for a shorter period of time. This legislation sets new standards for orders of protection, including up to an eight year duration for the orders.\n\"This legislation would assist victims of domestic violence,\" said Senator Steve Saland (R,C Poughkeepsie). \"Since I authored the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Intervention Act of 1994 I have been proud to see many additions to the law which have enhanced the protection available to children and families. This legislation would strengthen our laws so that we may better prevent the tragic consequences of domestic violence.\"\nBoth of these bills have been sent to the Assembly."}

The committee is examining concussions in sports, the military and other areas, NBC News reported.\nMiller was asked by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, whether he believed \"there is a link between football and degenerative brain disorders\" like CTE.\nMiller replied that some research \"shows that a number of retired NFL players were diagnosed with CTE, so the answer to that question is certainly yes,\" NBC News reported.\nSchakowsky asked again, \"Is there a link?\" Miller responded, \"Sure,\" but then added that he is not a doctor.\nMiller's acknowledgment of a connection between football and CTE could be a major shift in the discussion about head injuries in football, America's most popular sport, according to NBC News.\nMarijuana-Based Drug Reduces Epilepsy Seizures: Study\nAn experimental marijuana-based drug called Epidiolex reduced epilepsy patients' seizures, according to the company developing the drug.\nGW Pharmaceuticals said the drug was more effective than a placebo in reducing convulsive seizures in children with a rare type of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome, The New York Times reported.\nThe average age of the 120 patients in the study was 10 and they suffered an average of 13 convulsive seizures a month at the start of the study, despite taking other drugs. Half the children were given Epidiolex and half a placebo.\nDuring the 14-week study, those taking the drug had a 39 percent reduction in seizure frequency, compared with 13 percent in the placebo group. Major side effects of Epidiolex included drowsiness, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, fever, vomiting, and upper respiratory infection, The Times reported.\nFurther study findings will be presented at a medical conference, GW said.\nThe U.K.-based company said it will meet with U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials to discuss if the findings of this single study could be used to approve Epidiolex to treat Dravet syndrome. Currently, there are no drugs specifically approved for the condition, which affects about 5,000 children in the U.S., The Times reported.\nGW said the results of another trial of the drug for Dravet syndrome later this year, along with the results of two trials assessing its effectiveness in treating another form of epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut.\nIf approved by the FDA, Epidiolex would become the first marijuana-based prescription drug to be approved in the U.S., The Times reported.\nMarijuana extracts prepared by medical marijuana dispensers are being bought by some parents whose children with epilepsy are not helped by conventional drugs.\n\"The results of this Epidiolex pivotal trial are important and exciting, as they represent the first placebo-controlled evidence to support the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabidiol in children with Dravet syndrome,\" study principal investigator Dr. Orrin Devinsky, of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, said in a statement, The Times reported.\nDissolving Heart Stent to be Reviewed by FDA Panel\nPossible approval of a heart stent that dissolves into the body after helping open clogged arteries will be discussed by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel.\nStent maker Abbott Laboratories is seeking FDA approval for the first-of-kind Absorb device, but the agency has questions about its safety and effectiveness, the Associated Press reported.\nAn FDA review posted last week said a company study showed that rates of cardiovascular complications were slightly higher with Absorb than with a conventional metal stent, and that the risk of complications was higher when Absorb was used in smaller arteries.\nThe panel of outside experts will discuss available data about Absorb and advise the FDA on whether the device should be approved. The agency typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels, the AP reported.\nThe Absorb stent is already sold in Europe."}
{"text": "About the Council\nThe Council structure\nThe Council is made up of 30 councillors who are elected by local residents and represent 10 wards. The whole Council agrees overall policies. Day-to-day decisions are then made by the Executive comprising a leader and six councillors who are appointed by the Council.\nThe Executive's work is reviewed by a single Overview and Scrutiny Committee which considers a range of social, environmental and economic matters. The Overview and Scrutiny Committee is responsible for setting up task groups to look at different aspects of our work and can `call-in' (or stall) the Executive's decisions for further consideration.\nThe Council's vision is 'towards tomorrow today'.\nachieving things and looking to improve\nhaving a forward-thinking attitude\nbuilding on what is good today, and\nplanning and working for the future.\nMore information about our vision and values is available elsewhere on this site.\nWe provide a wide range of services and facilities and to help us to use our resources in the most effective way, we have to set priorities. We will focus on four key priority areas for the coming year, as follows.\ndecent and affordable housing\nhealth and well-being.\nDecent and affordable housing\nOne of the most important issues identified by our residents is the need to provide good-quality affordable housing for local people. This includes social housing as well as homes for key workers and others excluded from the open market because of the relationship between house prices to buy and rent and people's incomes.\nThe Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) carried out in 2008 identifies the need to provide 499 additional units of affordable housing per annum. Progress in this area has become increasingly difficult over recent years. Due to the economic climate, development activity has declined with few house builders starting on site in the Borough on schemes with an element of affordable housing. The affordable housing opportunities coming forward are therefore limited. The target of 499 additional units is unlikely to be achieved without a significant change in market conditions.\nIn spite of these challenges the Council is:\n- reviewing the suitability of its land holdings for the delivery of affordable housing;\n- working with Woking Borough Homes to continue its property acquisition programme;\n- adopting a revised affordable housing policy through the Local Development Framework;\n- progressing the Private Finance Initiative affordable housing scheme at Moor Lane.\nThe Council has agreed that economic development is an important area of work and has added this as a priority, to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and build for the future.\nEconomic development will focus on the following key objectives.\n- Supporting existing businesses in the Borough, enabling them to survive the economic downturn, to trade profitably and to create wealth locally and provide employment opportunities (both existing and additional)\n- Creating the right environment for and actively encouraging new businesses to locate in the Borough\n- Working to retain and encourage a balanced and varied economy and a range of employment sectors and opportunities across the Borough, so as to mitigate against the worst effects of the economic downturn on the local economy and community\n- Seeking to grow employment opportunities in high tech and leading edge businesses to enhance skill levels and earning potential, so as to increase local spending power and wealth distribution\n- Working with existing and new businesses to promote sustainability and further the Council's climate change agenda (e.g. reduction in CO2 emissions) and equal opportunities policies\n- Directly investing and working with the Town Centre Partnership and other partners to continue to promote and enhance the Town Centre's retail and leisure provision to encourage shoppers and other visitors\n- Working with other agencies and partners to ensure infrastructure (such as transport links) develops in line with residential and business growth\n- Seeking to encourage employment opportunities as local as possible to where people live, to create a sense of community and to reduce carbon mileage and congestion.\nTo improve the quality of life for people who live in, work in and visit the Borough, we must protect and improve the environment in ways which can be maintained without using up natural resources and are sustainable in the future. This includes working on reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change.\nWe are working to maintain a clean, healthy and safe environment and keep the amount of waste sent to landfill as low as possible and increase recycling.\nOur priorities include the following.\nContinuing to divert waste from landfill with our alternate weekly collection of waste and recyclables, weekly collection of food waste, garden waste collection service and recycling sites. These successful services have seen our recycling rate rise to over 50% in 2010, a major landmark.\nWorking with our partners, Serco, performance on street cleaning and grounds maintenance has seen a steady improvement. More needs to be done and changes have been made that should ensure improvements continue in future years.\nOur Climate Change Strategy provides a clear vision of how Woking wishes to achieve a low carbon and well-adapted area, integrating mitigation and adaptation. First adopted in 2002, it provides a short, medium and long term framework aligned with national targets under the Climate Change Act of at least an 80% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, against a 1990 baseline. The strategy incorporates three principal objectives: reduction in Borough-wide CO2 equivalent emissions; adaptation to climate change; and promotion of sustainable development.\nHealth and well-being\nWe contribute to the health and well-being of our residents through the work we do to make sure that buildings, businesses and the environment are not causing harm. We also work to encourage people to take part in leisure and cultural activities that are available to everyone.\nOur priorities include the following.\nProgressing the aims of the cultural strategy and meeting the community's needs, including bringing our development plans relating to arts, sports, health and well-being and green spaces into force.\nThe Lightbox, a new gallery and museum for Woking, opened in 2007 and we will continue to work with and support this prestigious project as a valuable community facility.\nIncreasing the number of people from all sections of the community taking part in sports and cultural activities and target programmes for under-represented groups.\nWorking with the Safer Woking Partnership to reduce crime, improve safety, and tackle anti-social behaviour.\nBeacon status recognises local councils which are delivering excellent public services. Winners are invited to share their experience and expertise to help other councils.\nThe Council has been successful in three categories:\n- Sustainable Energy, recognising our work developing innovative energy projects\n- Promoting Sustainable Communities through the Planning Process, in recognition of our work on developing affordable housing, energy efficient developments and better access to both local facilities and open spaces\n- Climate Change."}
{"text": "[erlang-questions] SMP for IO-bound applications\nThu Jun 21 20:37:44 CEST 2012\nAs part of my studies, I have recently been doing some performance\nevaluations on Erlang SMP improvements for IO-bound applications.\nThe applications I considered for the evaluation were Emysql driver (\nhttps://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql) and Mnesia.\nI have created an Erlang module for performing reads/writes from/to Mysql\nDB through Emysql driver, and another Erlang module for communicating with\nBoth the modules have two methods write(nr_records) which writes nr_records\nrecords to the database (MySQL, or Mnesia), and read(nr_records) which\nreads nr_records random records from the db. (both the reads and writes are\nconsecutive, not in chunks)\nI have a load generator tool which simulates simultaneous requests to both\nthe modules and gathers performance statistics. I generate as much load as\nneeded to stress the applications (near the saturation point)\nThe metrics I uses are the throughput (no. of sessions/sec), and the\nsession duration. A session is a call to write(nr_records)\nor read(nr_records) function depending on the test case (read or write). So\nif I call write(500), I measure the duration of a session that does 500\nhundred inserts into the database.\nThe tests I run have these parameters:\nA)Type of operations: 1- Reads 2-Writes\nI have just one table with 20 fields, and the reads and writes are just\nselect and insert operations in that table\nB) I/O applications: 1- Emysql 2-Mnesia\nC) SMP parameters:\n1- SMP enabled, no. of schedulers = no. of cpu cores\n2-SMP enabled, no. of schedulers = 1\n3- SMP disabled\nD) Erlang OTP versions:\n1- Erlang R12B (The SMP has only one run-queue and multiple schedulers)\n2- Erlang R15B (Improved SMP, 1 run-queue per each scheduler)\nThe tests included all possible combinations from A,B,C,D. They were run in\nSolaris 10 x86 (a 16 cores machine).\nIn general these were the results I got:\n1- There is a a big difference in performance between SMP enabled and\ndisabled in both the Erlang versions (R12 and R15) for both read and write\ntests. So I can say that SMP rocks! However, you have to have enough load\nto achieve that (for low load I could not see any difference, sometimes it\nwas even better to disable SMP)\n2- I was expecting a much better performance for SMP enabled (no. of cores\n= no. of schedulers) in R15 than in R12, since the schedulers' logic has\nchanged a lot from R12 to R15. But the results were more or less the same.\nI was thinking since I had a multithreaded db like MySql, a multiple\ndb-connections driver as Emysql, and SMP with multiple schedulers with\ntheir own run queues, I could get better results than in R12 where there is\nonly one run-queue and multiple schedulers (more lock contention).\nIs it maybe because the processes are just doing IO and nothing\n3- I realized that CPU usage in R15 SMP enabled is twice higher than the\nCPU use in R12 SMP enable. All the cores have a CPU usage over 90%, and I\ncan see that the beam process is using up to 75-80% of the CPU, the rest is\nthe mysql daemon process. Is it because in R15 the scheduling algorithm has\nbecome more complex?\nI have only one table (as I said before) created with the attribute\ndisc_copies, and it is stored only in one node. The whole table fits in\nRAM, and I tried to keep it simple by controlling the size of the table\nduring my tests, in order not exceed RAM capacity\n4- For the write tests in Mnesia I see the same behavior as in Mysql.\nHowever, since the data are all loaded in RAM, the session duration is\nshorter, and the gain in performance between SMP enabled and disabled is\nnot as huge as in Mysql.\n5- For the read tests, I have two observations. First, the dirty reads are\n10 times faster than the reads that use transactions. Second, I have better\nresults for SMP disabled (twice faster, though in both cases the session\nduration is in order of millisecods, 70 msec vs 30 msec).\n6- Same as in Mysql, no difference in performance between R12 and R15 with\nSMP enabled, for both read and write tests.\nIf you have read so far, and have a comment on my results, you are welcome.\nEspecially about the no difference btw R12 and R15 and the high CPU usage\nin R15 when the applications are IO-bound.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nMore information about the erlang-questions"}
{"text": "Excerpt: The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits\nThis book is a result of a long and lonely journey for me. It started during the Christmas vacation of 1995. During that period of celebration and good cheer, one issue kept nagging me: What are we doing about the poorest people around the world? Why is it that with all our technology, managerial know-how, and investment capacity, we are unable to make even a minor contribution to the problem of pervasive global poverty and disenfranchisement? Why can't we create inclusive capitalism? Needless to say, these are not new questions. However, as one who is familiar with both the developed and the developing world, the contrasts kept gnawing at me. It became clear that finding a solution to the problems of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid around the world should be an integral part of my next intellectual journey. It was also clear that we have to start with a new approach, a \"clean sheet of paper.\" We have to learn from the successes and failures of the past; the promises made and not fulfilled. Doing more of the same, by refining the solutions of the past-- developmental aid, subsidies, governmental support, localized nongovernmental organization (NGO)-based solutions, exclusive reliance on deregulation and privatization of public assets--is important and has a role to play, but has not redressed the problem of poverty. Although NGOs worked tirelessly to promote local solutions and local entrepreneurship, the idea of large-scale entrepreneurship as a possible solution to poverty had not taken root. It appeared that many a politician, bureaucrat, and manager in large domestic and global firms agreed on one thing: The poor are wards of the state. This implicit agreement was bothersome. The large-scale private sector was only marginally involved in dealing with the problems of 80 percent of humanity. The natural question, therefore, was this: What if we mobilized the resources, scale, and scope of large firms to co-create solutions to the problems at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP), those 4 billion people who live on less than $2 a day? Why can't we mobilize the investment capacity of large firms with the knowledge and commitment of NGOs and the communities that need help? Why can't we co-create unique solutions? That was the beginning of my journey to understand and motivate large firms to imagine and act on their role in creating a more just and humane society by collaborating effectively with other institutions.\nIt was obvious that managers can sustain their enthusiasm and commitment to activities only if they are grounded in good business practices. The four to five billion people at the BOP can help redefine what \"good business practice\" is. This was not about philanthropy and notions of corporate social responsibility. These initiatives can take the process of engagement between the poor and the large firm only so far. Great contributions can result from these initiatives, but these activities are unlikely to be fully integrated with the core activities of the firm. For sustaining energy, resources, and innovation, the BOP must become a key element of the central mission for large private-sector firms. The poor must become active, informed, and involved consumers. Poverty reduction can result from co-creating a market around the needs of the poor.\nWe have to discard many of the \"for and against\" views of the world. For example, \"are you for globalization or against it\" is not a good question. Globalization, like all other major social movements, brings some good and some bad. Similarly, global versus local is not a useful debate. The tensions are real. Very early in my career, I learned that even within the multinational corporation (MNC) that is not a settled debate. Similarly, the debate between small (e.g., microfinance) and large (e.g., multinational firms) is not a useful debate either. Large business can bring efficiency. NGOs can bring creativity to solve the problems that face us all. Certainly, I wanted to avoid the paternalism towards the poor that I saw in NGOs, government agencies, and MNCs.\nThis book is concerned about what works. This is not a debate about who is right. I am even less concerned about what may go wrong. Plenty can and has. I am focused on the potential for learning from the few experiments that are going right. These can show us the way forward. I do not want the poor of the world to become a constituency. I want poverty to be a problem that should be solved. This book is about all of the players--NGOs, large domestic firms, MNCs, government agencies, and most importantly, the poor themselves--coming together to solve very complex problems that we face as we enter the 21st century. The problem of poverty must force us to innovate, not claim \"rights to impose our solutions.\"\nThe starting point for this transition had to be twofold. First, we should consider the implications of the language we use. \"Poverty alleviation\" and \"the poor\" are terms that are loaded with meaning and historical baggage. The focus on entrepreneurial activities as an antidote to the current malaise must be on an active, underserved consumer community and a potential for global growth in trade and prosperity as the four to five billion poor become part of a system of inclusive capitalism. We should commence talking about underserved consumers and markets. The process must start with respect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals. The process of co-creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problemsolvers. Consumers and consumer communities will demand and get choice. This process of creating an involved and activist consumer is already emerging. The BOP provides an opportunity to turbocharge this process of change in the traditional relationship between the firm and the consumer. Second, we must recognize that the conversion of the BOP into an active market is essentially a developmental activity. It is not about serving an existing market more efficiently. New and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned. That is the challenge.\nOnce the basic approach was clear, the opportunities became obvious. The new viewpoint showed a different landscape and a focus on early and quiet attempts by some firms to explore this terrain. Unilever and its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Lever Limited, was one such early experimenter. Around 1997, I found a kindred spirit in colleague Professor Stu Hart at the University of Michigan Business School (UMBS), who was approaching similar problems from a sustainable development perspective. We produced a working paper called \"The Strategies for the Bottom of the Pyramid.\" Needless to say, not a single journal would accept the article for publication. It was too radical. Reviewers thought that it did not follow the work of developmental economists. Nobody noticed that we were offering an alternative to the traditional wisdom of how to alleviate global poverty. Thanks to the Web, various revisions of the working paper circulated freely. Surprisingly, a number of managers read it, accepted its premise, and started to initiate action based on it. Managers at Hewlett-Packard, DuPont, Monsanto, and other corporations started a venture fund and dedicated senior managers' time and energy to examine this opportunity. Meanwhile, the Digital Dividend conference organized by Dr. Allen Hammond and the World Resources Institute in Seattle in 1999 provided a forum to examine these ideas in depth. I have not looked back. Since 1997, I have used every possible platform--academic, managerial, and governmental--to push the idea of the BOP as a market and a source of innovations. During the last five years, slowly at first but now more rapidly, a large number of NGOs, academics, and managers have started to discuss the need for an alternate approach to poverty alleviation and the potential role of the private sector and entrepreneurship as one of the critical elements.\nThe publication of the two articles, \"The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid,\" in Strategy+Business (January 2002) with Stu Hart, and \"Serve the World's Poor, Profitably\" in the Harvard Business Review (September 2002) with Allen Hammond, facilitated the process of widespread discussion within corporations. Today, the discussion is not about \"whether\" but how fast and where. We have come a long way. In the fall of 2002, several MBA students at the UMBS came to me and said that they would like to work with me on BOP issues and that they were intrigued by the ideas they had seen in print as well as my message in numerous lectures on campus and outside. I was not easily convinced. I imposed extraordinary demands on them to convince me that they really cared. They convinced me overwhelmingly. They were ready to travel, explore opportunities, and endure the painful task of assembling convincing evidence. That was the start of the now widely accepted XMAP projects (a variant of International Multidisciplinary Action Projects [IMAP], which UMBS has long supported with faculty mentoring.) The X in XMAP stood for experimental. The enthusiasm of the students, especially Cynthia Casas and Praveen Suthrum, provided the glue and helped see the project through administrative difficulties. I am grateful to all the MBA students whose dedication made this book possible.\nThe book is in three parts. In Part I we develop a framework for the active engagement of the private sector at the BOP. It provides the basis for a profitable win-win engagement. The focus is on the nature of changes that all players--the large firm, NGOs, governmental agencies, and the poor themselves--must accept to make this process work. Part II describes 12 cases, in a wide variety of businesses, where the BOP is becoming an active market and bringing benefits, far beyond just products, to consumers. The cases represent a wide variety of industries--from retail, health, and financial services to agribusiness and government. They are located in Peru, Brazil, Nicaragua, Mexico, and India. They represent a wide variety of institutions working together-- subsidiaries of MNCs, large domestic firms, startups, and NGOs. They are all motivated by the same concern: They want to change the face of poverty by bringing to bear a combination of high-technology solutions, private enterprise, market-based solutions and involvement of multiple organizations. They are solving real problems. The BOP consumers get products and services at an affordable price, but more important, they get recognition, respect, and fair treatment. Building self-esteem and entrepreneurial drive at the BOP is probably the most enduring contribution that the private sector can make. Finally, decision-makers do not often hear the voices of the poor. We tend to make assumptions about how they feel. Part III (video stories on CD) is an attempt to tell the story primarily from their perspective. Each of the research teams-- MBA students--went with video cameras and recorded their conversations with the BOP consumers as well as with the company managers. We collected well over 100 hours of video as part of the research. We present 35 minutes of the story from the point of view of the BOP consumers, the so-called poor. They are the primary storytellers. They tell us in their language--from Portuguese to Hindi-- their view of what the involvement of the private sector and the resultant transition have meant for them. The three parts--the rationale for and the approach to private-sector involvement, the in-depth case studies, and the voices of the BOP consumers--are all an integral part of the book. They are intended to focus not only on the intellectual but also on the emotional arguments for encouraging private-sector engagement. No research of this nature can be done without the active support of firms and managers. They gave us open access, their time, and their insights. Their enthusiasm was infectious. None of us who was a part of the research need any more convincing. We do know that the entrepreneurship and inventiveness of dedicated managers can bring a sea of change rapidly. That is true across the world. We could not have documented the richness of the transformation taking place at the BOP through the efforts of dedicated management teams without an unstinting effort by the students. The names of the students who were involved in developing the cases stories are given at the end of the book. Research of this nature, on the cutting edge, cannot take place in an academic institution without the active support of the dean. Dean Robert J. Dolan bet on the initiative. Associate Dean Michael D. Gordon remained a constant source of encouragement to me and to the students in all stages of the project, from obtaining enough video cameras to providing substantive inputs to the research. His deep belief and commitment to the research agenda were critical to the project. Several of my colleagues provided support. I owe special thanks to Associate Dean Gene Anderson, Associate Dean Izak Duenyas, and colleagues Andy Lawlor and Jan Svejnar, former Director of the William Davidson Institute.\nIt was fortuitous that Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, constituted a special commission on Private Sector and Development under the auspices of the United Nations Development Program and its Administrator Mark Malloch Brown. As a member of the Commission, I had a chance to share my ideas with the members of the Commission and staff and found a very useful platform for dialogue. Nissim Ezekiel, Yann Risz, Sahb Sobhani, Jan Krutzinna, and Naheed Nenshi showed great willingness to debate and challenge many of the ideas presented in this book. I have benefited from their dialogue. It is my hope that the body of work represented in this book influenced the thinking of the Commission as well.\nNo project of this size can be done without the active support of a wide variety of people. Cynthia Shaw (UMBS) and Fred Wessells provided editorial assistance in reducing the mountain of data we had collected on each case story into a manageable document. Russ Hall provided additional editorial support and helped in considerably improving the case studies and the text. Many of my colleagues, including Prof. M. S. Krishnan, Prof. Venkat Ramaswamy, Prof. Michael Gordon, and Ron Bendersky (Executive Education, UMBS) helped with detailed suggestions for improving the text. Hrishi Bhattacharyya (Unilever), Allen Hammond (World Resources Institute), and Jeb Brugmann and Craig Cohon (Globalegacy) provided useful insights. The Wharton Business Publishing team has been exceptional in its support and belief in the message. Jerry Wind (Wharton) accepted the idea of this book with great enthusiasm. The editorial team led by Tim Moore and including John Pierce and Martin Litkowski was remarkable in their support. Their commitment to this book has been a source of strength. Patti Guerrieri was always willing to help and produced yet another revision of the manuscript with patience and quiet competence. Kimberly Ward (UMBS) oversaw the entire project, and Brian Greminger worked magic with the videos. Both of them, by their dedication to the students and to the overall project, were a source of inspiration. Finally, the students stayed with the project for over a year, always managing to do more and accommodating what must have appeared to be random demands on their time.\nThe biggest supporters of this project were my family. Our children, Murali Krishna and Deepa, and the latter's husband, Ashwin, kept me going when I was willing to give up the idea of writing a book-length manuscript. As always, my wife, Gayatri, was my source of strength. She deeply believed in the cause and accompanied me to a wide variety of onsite visits, be it Jaipur Foot or the Shakti Amma. She willingly created the space and time for me to work on this project.\nIt is my hope that this book will provide the impetus for a more active engagement of the private sector in building the marketing ecosystems for transforming the BOP."}
{"text": "Most of us wonder whether we would ever act heroically, but director Yoav Shamir has actually made a documentary on the subject. His latest film, 10% – What Makes a Hero?, which opens this week at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque, is a funny but often provocative look at the nature of heroism, as well as a chronicle of the director’s changing reactions to his own research.\nThe 10 percent mentioned in the title refers to a famous experiment done by a US researcher in the Sixties in which volunteers were told to administer electric shocks to subjects who answered questions incorrectly.\nEven though the volunteers were told they were administering incredibly painful and even life-threatening voltages, 90 percent of them did as they were told.\nOnly 10% refused to cooperate and would not harm the subjects (who knew what the experiment was really about and did not actually receive any electric shocks).\nShamir began looking into this research (rare footage of which is included in his documentary) after he saw a photo on Facebook of one man in a crowd at a Nazi rally who refused to give the Nazi salute.\nBecoming obsessed with this man, “I tried to track him down. But so many people said, ‘This is my grandfather,’ or ‘I knew this person’ that we had to give up any hope of finding that man.”\nStill, “this image brought together the question of heroism for me, of how I would act, if I would be a hero.”\nWhile scientists in Israel cautioned him that there was no way to predict how he would behave in any given situation (although they did confirm that he has a gene associated with altruism), he continued to research the subject.\nThe film records his journey and observations as he interviews researchers who work with different types of monkeys (one kind that kills intruders and another that never fights); a New York City “subway hero” who rescued a man who fell onto the subway tracks after having a seizure; a gentile woman who risked her life by hiding Jews during the Holocaust; his grandmother, the widow of two men who died heroically; a neurological researcher who amassed a fortune and gave away almost all his money; a representative of the Ayn Rand foundation, which advocates “rational self-interest”; Yonatan Shapira, an Israeli peace activist; and others.\n“It was one of the hardest movies I’ve ever done,” says Shamir, who recently returned from screening the film in Germany and Poland. He has made several acclaimed documentaries that have been shown widely around the world, including Checkpoint (2003) and Defamation (2009).\nAlthough he served in an anti-terror unit in the IDF, he says “I didn’t feel I had the opportunity to be a hero in the army.” But it was a subject that fascinated him, and after seeing the Facebook photo of the Nazi rally, he got started.\n“I like to be ready when I start my films, but not overly ready,” he explains, so that he is open to ideas and approaches he encounters while filming.\nWhile getting started was easy, “Defining what is a hero is an endless subject,” he says, and it was difficult to know when to stop.\n“It’s like The Wizard of Oz; every step gives you a clearer picture of what is it you are looking for. And for me, with this subject, you just start investigating it and it influences you to look at life differently.”\nALTHOU GH THERE are many comic moments in the film, Shamir takes it seriously, saying, “I looked at very different cultures, and there is something universal about wanting to do good.”\nIn one of the film’s most challenging scenes, a representative of the Ayn Rand Institute questions whether doing good makes us feel good, as others in the film suggest.\nHe posits that we feel good when we do what we have been conditioned to believe is good, and suggests that Nazis killing Jews may have felt a warm glow in the pleasure centers in their brain that a neuroscientist claims are affected when we perform an altruistic action.\nShamir lets the Ayn Rand devotee have his say. “Many people believe this,” he points out. “In America, many Republicans say this.\nMy seven-year-old daughter believes if I give you something, you will have more, I’ll have less, I’ll be weaker. It is sensible.”\nIn the end, though, even after Shamir is injured in a peace demonstration, he retains his belief in heroism and altruism as a way of life.\n“I’m an atheist; you have to believe in something,” he says, explaining why he included a meeting with a cult that believes in free love and aliens in the film.\nBut he admits that he has not answered the questions that drove him to make the film, although he has learned a lot about himself and the world.\nThe closest he can get to a conclusion is this: “When we were coming up with a quote for the T-shirts for the movie, we found this saying by Bertolt Brecht: ‘Unhappy is the land that needs a hero.’”"}
{"text": "07-Apr-2003 -- This Confluence falls in the northern limits of the geographical region known as the Karoo, which covers a large part of South Africa. This area has low average rainfall, and is very sparsely populated, mostly by livestock and game farmers. I accompanied my wife, who took some of her post-graduate students for a field trip to Philippolis, a small but historical town in the southern Free State province. The CP lies ± 40 km northwest of Philippolis, and south of Jagersfontein and Koffiefontein (Coffee fountain), both diamond-mining towns established in the 1870's. After a visit to the Van der Post Centre, dedicated to Sir Laurens van der Post who was born in the town, I set off on a gravel road, which leads to the CP. The road passed the Confluence, at the closest point six kilometres to the south, separated by a low mountain ridge which ran parallel to the road.\nJust about here I found a faint jeep track which veered off the road through an opening in the mountains, vaguely in the direction of the CP. The going on the track became progressively worse as I entered a valley amongst the mountains, at some parts I had to engage low-range four-wheel drive to make progress. The track ended at a wind pump feeding a small reservoir, at the foot of yet another ridge. I left my car there and set off on a 2 ½ -kilometre hike. It was a dry, hot day, the temperature above 30 degrees Celsius. On cresting the ridge I found another valley with a freestanding hill in front of me, and realised that I would have to do some more steep climbing to get to the CP. The point turned out to be 3 meters below the summit.\nOn my way back to the car I hoped that the next day's Confluence (see 30S 24E) would be on level ground. On approaching my car I saw a zebra (Equus burchelli) and two strange animals, which from a distance looked like donkeys. Getting closer I realised that although they had the colouring of donkeys, they had the build of a zebra. I don't know whether this was the result of some experiment or a case of spontaneous crossbreeding between two species of the horse family."}
{"text": "Earlier this year, Democrats in the Senate tried three times to pass legislation that would help states deal with growing Medicaid rolls, the joint federal-state health care program for the poor. Each effort has failed in the face of united Republican obstructionism. Earlier this month, The Washington Post explained clearly why this legislation should pass:\n“States are staggering under the impact of the economic slump, with revenue down and demand for social services up. Some 30 states were counting on the Medicaid money to balance their budgets, as required by law. The other cuts they would be forced to make if the Medicaid funds are not forthcoming would further slow the economic recovery. Passing this package is the right thing to do, and fiscally prudent too.”\nThe failure to pass this help for states, experts agree, will cause as many as a million additional job losses in both the private and the public sectors. Yet Senate Republicans continue to block passage.\nNow, thanks to the leadership of Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the Senate has one more chance to do the right thing and protect nearly a million more jobs from going down the drain. Later today, the U.S. Senate has scheduled a cloture vote on a bill – H.R. 1586 – that will provide $26 billion in funding to help states deal with their budget shortfalls, bolster Medicaid and fund education jobs. But it’s up to us to win it. The Republican congressional leadership has made their strategy clear – they will say no at all costs.\nThis funding is fully paid for, so it is simply false for opponents to say that passage would increase the deficit. However I would be remiss if I didn’t note that a part of the funding comes from a cut in future Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamp) benefits. However, it does not take effect until 2015, which gives us plenty of time to mobilize to make sure the cut never happens.\nYet, Republican opposition to the help for the states and the education money – even if it’s paid for – intensifies as we inch closer toward November. Quite frankly, it looks clear to many that Republican leaders are doing everything they can to bring down the economy for political gain.\nThey think they will benefit on Election Day if more Americans lose their jobs and unemployment grows. It’s in keeping with their leader Rush Limbaugh’s professed goal in the early days of the Obama administration: “I want him to fail.” Far too many GOP legislators are taking their cues from extremists on the right, and not listening to the message that voters are sending – it’s time to end the partisanship and look out for the interest of the American people.\nBy a margin of more than 2 to 1, Americans believe that saving and creating jobs is more important than reducing the federal deficit to move our economy forward. Considering how tone-deaf Washington has become on jobs, it’s no wonder Americans are gloomy about the nation’s economic recovery. Republican senators need to make a choice: Are they going to continue to obstruct, or will they stand with American families who want our economy to grow and want to put people back to work?\nIf we fail to break the Republicans legislative lockdown today, there should be no doubt that there will be more pain for working families, more debt and a prolonged recession. Every senator needs to know that it’s time to stop the obstruction. It’s time to protect American jobs.\nIf you care about the future of our economy and the jobs of nearly a million Americans, call your senators immediately and tell them to vote yes on cloture.\nYou can click on this link to make the call. Let me know that you’ve done it. It’s time to get our economy and our country working again."}

{"text": "My first year of teaching in Detroit was a blur, and I often felt like a struggling swimmer treading water. Each day a new crisis arose, and each day I learned something new about being a teacher and a human. There was the day I learned the social and physical responsibilities of being a teacher when a pep rally ended with police macing and arresting my students. There was the time I learned well-designed graphic organizers increase independent student learning. There was the day that I learned a grade-level meeting was most efficient when a clear agenda was established with actionable steps that recognized everyone’s talents and the collective mission of the school. However, there were even more days that I realized there was so much I did not know.\nLuckily, I had a strong network of teachers both in and outside of my school that cared about my personal and professional development. Had it not been for their willingness to listen, excellent guidance, and insight into school and district policy as well as the nuances of educational realities, I would not have been the teacher I needed to be for my students, nor stayed in the field of education.\nThe reality is early career educators are thrust into their role assuming the same, and sometimes even greater responsibilities, of 20-year veterans. The increasing district, state, and federal demands on educators further complicates this onerous task for teachers who are wrestling with the daunting responsibility of educating and nurturing the children under their care. Given the demanding nature of the profession, it becomes easy to understand why so many early educators leave the profession in their first 3 to 5 years in the classroom.\nAs a response to this loss of teachers who leave the profession for jobs offering greater financial rewards or less stressful environments, many states, including New York, are now adopting programs to support early career teachers. These induction programs seek to identify common needs for early educators and support them. However, clarity around what these induction programs will look like has not been flushed out, and, in the meantime, wonderful new teachers are in need of support.\nThe New Teacher Network at Teachers College (NTN@TC) seeks to fill that void for recent TC graduates. NTN@TC has surveyed research on early career educators to identify the common areas of struggle for new(er) teachers, specifically classroom management, motivating students, differentiating instruction, assessing student work (in a timely fashion), and relations with parents. NTN@TC also approaches this coaching and support understanding that unsupportive environments compound the struggles of early career educators. Therefore, NTN@TC has designed workshops, podcasts, a blog, online forums, and hands on coaching to provide the necessary support and cultivate an educator community that enables growth and encourages collaboration.\nNTN@TC aims to provide key levers of professional support that respects teacher’s individuality and provides the tools for professional growth in a non-evaluative way.\nIn the coming weeks, our podcasts will highlight different pedagogical techniques that can be used in the classroom and pressing educational issues to situate our work as educators in the civic sphere, this blog will continue to provide additional resources and tools for teachers in the network to use and implement in the classroom, and we will continue to come into your classrooms (as asked) to help you develop.\nThere is no more noble profession than teaching, and (I would argue) no harder job than being a quality educator. Our goal at NTN@TC is to help you in anyway you see as needed. Let us know what we can do to help!"}
{"text": "Would You like to be a Volunteer?\nVolunteers work toward CBC goals by becoming advocates in nursing homes, joining the speaker's bureau, and helping with office work. The need for quality long term care has never been more essential. Volunteers and employees of Citizens for Better Care strive to help ensure this need is met.\nOmbudsman, or Advocates, are individuals who commit to visit residents in nursing homes to listen, educate, advocate, and empower residents and their families. They help monitor conditions in the home and agree to a one-year commitment to visit a selected home (or homes) two to three times per month.\nVolunteer advocates in the Citizens for Better Care Long Term Care Ombudsman program uphold the rights of Michigan's nursing home residents. CBC volunteers work to ensure that residents are treated in the same way people who live at home take for granted. Trained volunteer advocates are the key to CBC's program. It is a serious volunteer job which can have a meaningful effect on the lives of nursing home residents.\nIn many nursing homes the volunteer advocate is seen as an educational resource for staff as well as residents.\nVolunteer Advocate Training\nVolunteers attend at least six hours of training before they are assigned to a nursing home. Training acquaints them with life in nursing homes. This orientation includes information on:\n- Philosophy of the CBC Ombudsman Program\n- Characteristics of Nursing Homes\n- Resident's Rights\n- Licensing and Regulation of Nursing Homes\n- Problems in Nursing Homes\n- The Role of Volunteer Advocates\n- Communication Skills\n- Nursing Home Visit Protocol\nAdditional trainings are held regularly. Topics range from how to organize family councils to updates on new legislation. They also let volunteers meet and share experience. Volunteers initially visit their assigned nursing home with a staff member, someone they can continue to count on for guidance.\nElder Abuse Prevention Education Volunteer\nElder Abuse Prevention Volunteers travel to various community centers, colleges, and long term care facilities to educate and inform people how to prevent, identify, and report suspected cases of abuse to the elderly. Presentation materials and training are provided to you and events are scheduled by our Elder Abuse Coordinator.\nA background in public speaking is recommended.\nOther Volunteer Opportunities:\nEach CBC office has volunteer needs that enhance our work. Volunteers who:\n- answer phones\n- help us with filing, mailings and other office procedures\n- represent CBC at a health fair\n- help with a fund-raising event\nHow Do I Become A Volunteer?\nCall your nearest CBC office. You will be sent an informational packet that includes an application. Or print out the page here for the volunteer application, and the permission to perform background check. Please fill out and mail or fax it to the office you would like to volunteer at. After your application is received, you will receive a phone call to establish a time to meet with a CBC staff person to discuss the job further and determine if it is right for you."}
{"text": "The war stories from his grandfather, though sparse in detail, blended one moment of explosive drama with a vague reference of death -- all wrapped around a description of how old-school military men used to handle both experiences.\nDavid Weidman, who spent two tours in Afghanistan with the Air Force, recalls his late grandfather, a veteran of World War II and Korea, telling him that he survived having his body and his Jeep blown through a wall. He did not reveal to Weidman where that attack happened. He also gave his grandson some advice: \"You don't want to be in a foxhole talking to a guy one minute and then you turn around and he's dead. You just don't want to experience that.\"\n\"He said he just dealt with it all. It's that same mentality: 'I did what I had to do. I got myself better then I went back to work.' Other than that, he never spoke about the wars at all. That tells me he never did deal with it,\" added Weidman, 32.\nCultural fault lines clearly run between generations of veterans who saw action in different conflicts or who wore the uniform in different eras, including peacetime. The refrain echoed by some older veterans to some younger ex-service members: \"We had it so much harder than today's military.\"\nIt is, quite likely, a tradition that hearkens back to the Civil War or possibly the Revolutionary War, according to some ex-service members. But many post-9/11 veterans who have chatted with older veterans revealed the sentiment they've often heard carry the same note: \"We just came home, put our heads down and got to work -- without any whining.\"\nBuried, not so subtly, in that message is that the current crop is a tad less tough and lot more needy. Some of that cultural gap may have to do with how aging veterans were taught not to talk about combat stress whereas today's military members are constantly urged to open up about any symptoms of anxiety they're feeling. It's a battle of Macho circa 1945 or 1970 versus Macho 2012.\nFor more of this story:\nCopyright 2013 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved."}
{"text": "An early incarnation of my homebrew turnstile at my previous home. It is mounted below the 2m collinear antenna I used with my UIView APRS IGATE and I added a separate vertical dipole as the diversity antenna. Unfortunately verticals seem very prone to terrestrial noise pickup and the pager tower although several miles from this location still caused problems although obviously not as bad as I get at my current location. I ended up only only using the turnstile. A further problem was the location – the large chimney is due north of the antenna and I believe it cause some obstruction of satellites at low elevations to the north.\nThe picture on the left shows the fourth physical incarnation of essentially the same antenna – A pair of two element yagis mounted at right angles and fed 90 degrees out of phase using a quarter wave of coax. The design was optimised on polar diagram and gain.\nTwo versions were constructed from 8mm microbore central heating pipe and 40mm waste pipe. The other two (including the one pictured) used copper wires twisted together using an electric drill. Twisted wire elements tend to droop a little as can be seen but this doesn’t seem to seriously affect performance.\nThese notes are brief as there is nothing especially taxing with the construction…\nIt is advisable to fit a short length of plastic rod between the dipole halves when using 8mm tube and a short length of plastic tube with a cutout for soldering the connections over the twisted wire in those versions.\nA “dirty balun” should be formed by taking the coax through the tube wrapping it around 5 times and then taking it inside to make the connections. The necessary holes should be marked and drilled before connecting the coax.\nTo achieve the necessary right hand circular polarization one dipole of the pair is fed through a quarter wave of coax from the feed point of the other. This diagram should make plain where the inners need to go. Getting this wrong will result in left hand circular polarisation and an antenna that doesn’t work.\nDipole: 99cm (8mm tube) 100cm (twisted wire)\n1/4 wave delay line – I used 75ohm TV Coax and using the MFJ analyser the length worked out to 39.5cm.\nHere are the EZNec plots of a two element yagi with these dimensions. Lack of skill and laziness mean I haven’t produced a plot for the complete turnstile.\nIf someone with multiple personalities threatens to kill himself, is it considered a hostage situation?"}

{"text": "Some diamonds have achieved worldwide fame for their exquisite beauty and size of the stone as well as for the people who have owned them. One of the most famous examples is the 3106 carat Cullinan, which is the largest rough, gem-quality diamond ever found. It weighed approximately 1⅓ pounds and was slightly less than 4 inches long, over 2 inches wide and more than 2.5 inches high.\nThe Cullinan was discovered in Transvaal, South Africa in 1905 at the Premier Mine and named for the owner of the mine, Thomas Cullinan. Initially it was believed that it may be part of a larger diamond because of the flat surface on one side, although another piece has never been found.\nThe huge, uncut diamond was sold to the Transvaal government for $1 million, who then gave it to England’s King Edward VII in thanks for granting Transvaal their independence. The king sent the stone to the Asscher’s Diamond Company in Amsterdam where it was cut into 9 major gemstones, 96 smaller stones and approximately 19.5cts of unpolished pieces.\nThe largest diamond cut from the Cullinan was the pear-shaped, 530.2 carat Cullinan I (also known as the Great Star of Africa). The 74 faceted stone is the largest fine-quality, colorless diamond in the world and is set into the British Royal Scepter. The 317.4 carat cushion cut Cullinan II (Lesser Star of Africa) is the second largest stone cut from the Cullinan and is mounted on the band of the Imperial State Crown.\nThe pear-shaped 94.40 carat Cullinan III is the third largest stone cut from the Cullinan and was used as the finial of Queen Mary’s Crown. The cushion shaped, 63.60-carat Cullinan IV was set into the band of the crown. Both stones can be worn together as a pendent-brooch and are seen worn that way in paintings of Queen Mary as well as on Elizabeth II.

His parents have located a great school where the student population is made up of approximately 40% of students with Aspergers and there are openings.It is a fabulous opportunity, however the tuition is far beyond their means.

Any leads to some resources would be greatly appreciated.\nI have a six,soon to be 7 year old son who has been diagnosed with ADHD and Aspbergers disorder. He attends a public school in Illinois. I am looking for a private school, and scholarship information for him. He is very intelligent, he need to be adequately challenged. They took him out of kindergarten and put him in 1st grade last school year. Now he is in 2nd grade. he has an IQ of 150 at the age of 4. Can anybody give me any advice, or have any suggeations as to school for him. He is currently reading 215 wpm... He is a t 3rd and 4th grade math.\nI have the same question as Elilssa. My Son was diagnosed with ADHD and Aspergers. He was 10, now he is 22 and doing so well, but it is taking him a little longer to adjust. But his grades are good. I need help finding a bit more to help pay his next semester. How do I find the applications?"}
{"text": "Ah, Presidential elections. the time when all of America gets to find out all of the secrets of a small group of people. From affairs, to questionable business deals. Why does it seem like we can’t find a good candidate? Its because a good candidate needs balance, a balance of character and communication. All too often it seems like when we find someone who communicates effectively they have more skeletons in their closet than a haunted house. And all the ones with a seemingly spotless background can’t give a speech, or debate to save their life. Let’s look at some examples.\nA few things to never forget: “There is none righteous, no not one”(Romans 3:10), and every person has bloopers when they are communicating.\nThere is no argument he is possibly the best communicator in my lifetime(post Reagan). He can debate the socks of anyone, and give a speech that will move the most apathetic among us to action. But Newt is the perfect example of how a lapse of character and judgement years ago can haunt you for the rest of your life. Because of choices he made in his personal life some consider him unfit to be president. Newt is the epitome of why, at Patriot Academy, they teach that having good character is every bit as important as having the right stances on the issues.\nAll it takes is one mistake, one lapse of judgement, one failure of character to ruin your chances of being able to serve your country, and lead the change. That is why Patriot Academy puts so much emphasis on maintaining character that is above reproach.\nCompared to Newt, Rick Perry is a horse of a different color, both hold good political principles and values. But both have big problems, that are very different. Perry in his tenure at Governor of Texas only deviated from strict conservative principles a handful of time and most were minuscule. Governor Perry, compared to other candidates doesn’t have any skeletons in his closet. all those years of living in the public eye, and no controversies or conspiracies. You don’t find that often in a candidate.\nBut Perry’s problem was that he couldn’t communicate effectively, which is very out of the ordinary for the Governor. I personally think it had to do with the fact the he had very recently had back surgery, and between the pain and the medications, Perry was thrown off his game. But regardless, having the ability to communicate effectively is every bit as important as having spotless character.\nSo, what can we learn from this. Here are a few things:\n- Nobody has it all together. You are never going to find the complete package in a candidate.\n- Character is VITAL.\n- The right principles are VITAL.\n- Communication is just as VITAl.\n- And lastly, quit looking for the perfect candidate. You won’t find him. Because as Rick Green says: “Unless Jesus Christ is on the ballot you are going to be voting for the lesser of two evils.”"}

The plane is used to airlift tanks, supplies and troops as well as perform medical evacuations. It quickly became a war and disaster workhorse, prized for its ability to operate from basic airstrips and cover intercontinental distances with a full load without refueling.\nWith a payload of 160,000 pounds, it is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers and their equipment.\nAfter the ceremony, the Air Force's final C-17 took off, en route to Charleston Air Force Base, S.C. -- recreating the same flight the first production model took when it was delivered in July 1993. As the crowd on the ground cheered, the giant aircraft looped around and performed a low flyover before heading into the clouds.\nRachid Ali, a Boeing avionics inspector who has worked with C-17s for a dozen years, recounted the plane's service in Bosnia and Afghanistan. C-17s outfitted as mobile hospitals were regularly used to evacuate wounded military personnel during the Iraq War.\n\"It's an awesome airplane. Capability, reliability, it's above and beyond,\" Ali said. \"The first 50 are still flying. After 25 years, you can refurbish them and they're as good as new. It's going to be in the air for years to come.\"\nDesign work on the plane began at the million-plus square-foot Long Beach facility in 1981, when it was a McDonnell Douglas facility. Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s. At least 250 have been built, at a cost of about $311 million each when research, development and construction costs are included.\nThe Long Beach assembly line, which employees nearly 4,000 workers, still has pending orders in the foreign market. Boeing's overseas customers include the United Kingdom, Canada, India, Australia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and NATO.\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

{"text": "Advocates of political reform often make their case for change based on the fairer representation it will provide to people of color, women, third parties, and even Democrats and Republicans living in opposition districts. But what is equally compelling is a growing awareness that our \"winner-take-all\" electoral system has a distinct impact on policy. One of the clearest examples is the recent rush to war, and beyond that the extraordinary rise in military spending even before Sept. 11.\nWith national opinion polls reflecting ambivalence on the part of Americans over war in Iraq, particularly without a United Nations endorsement, one can't help but wonder why Congress has not reflected the nation's mood. When it comes to Middle East foreign policy, Congress has been to the right of the Israeli Knesset. There have been few voices of opposition, even among Democratic Party leaders, despite polls showing that Democratic voters are opposed to war by nearly 2 to 1.\nThe reasons for this are linked to the most fundamental aspects of our winner-take-all elections. Under the sway of pollsters, consultants, and strategists, Democratic leaders typically bend over backwards not to appear weak on defense. They have made the calculation that the voters who always vote for them will continue to do so, no matter what their stands on Iraq or Middle East policy, because those voters are not about to vote for Republicans. So these liberal and progressive voters mostly can be ignored. Instead, Democrats target their positions in such a way as to attract more conservative swing voters and independents, those undecided voters that determine winners in close races. Polls show this group evenly split over the question of war.\nThis is a calculated gambit by the Democratic Party leadership. Some of the Democratic House members would like to be more outspoken against the war, but they don't dare buck their leadership. And the leadership has made the winner-take-all calculation: \"Damn the torpedoes, forget the Democratic voters, focus on the SWING voters.\"\nWithout a third party in the Congress like a Green Party that is unequivocally against the war, most debate and dialogue came to a standstill long ago. In recent days, finally the Democratic Party leadership has awoken from its poll-driven slumber, but it's too little, too late. Neither Congress nor the president can say how much the Iraqi invasion will cost, but we do know that this bottomless pit will be fed by cutting other needed programs, including the chances for national healthcare, prescription drug benefits, and even adequate funding for homeland security.\nBut this is nothing new. Winner-take-all calculations always have produced bloated military budgets full of pork barrel waste and bipartisan brinkmanship. The story of the October 1999 military appropriations illustrates some of the worst dynamics and incentives resulting from our winner-take-all system.\nIn the spring of 1998, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that the military budget would remain steady at about $270 billion per year through 2002, as called for in the 1997 balanced budget agreement. But then came the impeachment attack in the summer. By the fall of 1998, key Republican hawks in Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that a president facing impeachment charges was ripe to be shaken down for more military spending. They presented Clinton with their demands, and to save his hide Clinton took steps to placate this powerful military constituency.\nClinton pledged a $1.1 billion \"emergency\" increase for military readiness, despite the fact that it broke the spending cap of the balanced-budget accord. But in the inevitable horse trading needed to close the deal, Congress transformed Clinton's modest readiness increase into a $9 billion grab bag of pet pork projects. GOP Sen. John McCain described it as \"the worst pork in recent memory.\" The pork included billions more for Star Wars, F-15 fighters, helicopters, and more awarded to the home areas of Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. Yes, this bread was buttered on both sides of the partisan aisle to ensure its palatability. Successive rounds of one-upmanship continued into 1999, pushing the price tag higher and higher until it reached stratospheric heights beyond what the Pentagon even had requested.\nCareful analysis reveals how winner-take-all dynamics drove this policy debacle. First came the impeachment attack -- driven by congressional pit bulls specifically selected by the Republican leadership because they represented heavily partisan districts where reelection was assured. Second, the attack occurred at the end of the decade with redistricting looming; at that time there is great incentive for partisan attacks in a bid to win state legislative elections, since state legislatures control the redistricting of legislative district lines in most states.\nThird, the partisan attack on the president created an opening for the military and congressional hawks to shake down a weakened president. Once the pigskin was put into play, successive rounds of bipartisan brinkmanship upped the ante -- and the price tag -- creating a pork barrel feeding frenzy.\nFourth, just like now with the Iraqi war, Clinton and the Democrats believed that, as an election year approached, their military positioning helped them with the more conservative swing voters and insulated them from the charge of being \"soft on defense.\" Thus, the nimble Clinton turned a political weakness into a victory, but at the price of paving the way for a liberal policy disaster -- a familiar refrain of his presidency.\nThe real losers were the American taxpayer and those desiring a peacetime economy. In an era when a conservative Congress has slashed domestic social spending, where 40 million Americans -- many of them children -- go without health care, and where we have levels of child poverty that approach that of Russia, the Pentagon still runs a bloated Cold War bureaucracy that the General Accounting Office has stated is \"still vulnerable to waste, abuse, and mismanagement.\" Yet the military budget passed in October 1999 was the largest increase since the Reagan era, even though it already was more than twice that of the combined military budgets of every conceivable adversary.\nEven before Sept. 11, the incentives of our winner-take-all system made it impossible for the Democrats to muster the political will to stop ongoing militarization. With winner-take-all offering powerful incentives for pork barrel gluttony, political positioning, courting of swing voters, redistricting manipulation, and partisan pit bull attacks, the waste and budgetary fraud known as military appropriations have rolled along as bipartisan policy.\nSteven Hill is senior analyst for the Center for Voting and Democracy (www.fairvote.org) and author of Fixing Elections: The Failure of America's Winner-Take-All Politics [Routledge Press, www.FixingElections.com]."}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Costa Rican President Oscar Arias presented an updated proposal to end the Honduran political crisis, but its adoption seemed unlikely, as one side described the talks as \"failed\" and the other asked for more time.\nHonduras' ousted President Manuel Zelaya answers questions in Managua, Nicaragua, on Sunday.\nThe document, dubbed the San Jose Accord, calls for ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya's return to power, the creation of a unity government and early elections.\nThe accord is very similar to an original plan suggested by Arias but with more details and a creation of a truth commission to investigate the events that led to the crisis. It also includes a timeline for its implementation, which could have Zelaya back in Honduras by Friday.\nArias signaled that his latest effort as mediator after two unsuccessful rounds of talks was also his final. Zelaya and his successor, interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti, can turn to other forms for negotiations if they cannot agree to the deal, Arias said.\nArias read the proposal on Wednesday at a news conference in San Jose, Costa Rica, flanked by Zelaya and Micheletti's delegations.\nResponses from the two camps following Arias announcement gave slim hope that the accord would be signed.\nZelaya delegate Rixi Moncada said the opportunity for compromise had already passed with Arias' original proposal, which Zelaya accepted but Micheletti rejected. Watch the reaction of the Organization of American States »\n\"(The talks) failed because of the intransigence of the coup regime,\" she said.\nFor Micheletti's side, Mauricio Villegas said his camp would present the San Jose Accord to the three branches of government for their approval, which would be necessary before moving forward. Earlier this week, another Micheletti negotiator said that the supreme court had already signaled that it would not accept Zelaya's return as president.\n\"We must make way for peace and democracy, because the alternative is a cliff where even bigger trouble than we know awaits,\" said Arias, who had been serving as mediator between the two sides. \"So today I ask you respectfully, but with urgency, to carefully review this document and reflect on it.\"\nEarlier, Micheletti had offered a counterproposal, Honduras's foreign minister, Carlos Lopez Contreras, told CNN affiliate Televicentro.\nSources close to Micheletti's delegation told CNN that the counterproposal would have given amnesty to Zelaya and allowed him to return. But the nation's Supreme Court, which supports the coup and insists Zelaya must be held responsible for allegedly trying to subvert the constitution, rejected the amnesty provision, the sources said.\nNegotiations had stalled over Arias' proposal that Zelaya be reinstated.\nZelaya was going to hold a referendum that could have led to changing the Honduras Constitution, even though Congress had outlawed the vote and the Supreme Court ruled it illegal.\nZelaya was deposed June 28, the day the vote was supposed to be held, in a military-led coup and replaced by congressional leader Micheletti a few hours later.\nMicheletti's counterproposal would have instituted a six-month moratorium on legal action against either side.\nIn another development, Honduras gave Venezuela's diplomats 72 hours to leave the country Tuesday on the grounds that leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has been making threats against the provisional government.\nVenezuela called the expulsion order \"absurd\" and said it will not comply because it does not recognize Micheletti's government. Chavez and Zelaya are political allies.\nThe coup has drawn international condemnation, including demands by the U.N. General Assembly and Organization of American States that Zelaya be reinstated. The European Union and United States also have curtailed some aid.\nMicheletti has steadfastly refused, saying Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup.\n|Most Viewed||Most Emailed||Top Searches|"}

Quit smoking.\nThe list of health issues caused by smoking is lengthy for both men and women, but women who smoke are even more likely to develop serious medical conditions.\nAccording to an article on the Mayo Clinic website, women who smoke run a higher risk of succumbing to one of the top five illnesses that affect women, which are heart disease, cancer, stroke, COPD and Alzheimer’s disease.\nIt has been said that breaking a habit takes around two weeks. And for you smokers out there, that could seem like a lifetime. You may be worried about all the stigmas attached to quitting smoking: you’ll gain weight, you’ll be moody and cranky, you’ll get terrible headaches. But the truth is, if you can stick it out for a handful of weeks, the benefits of quitting smoking will far outweigh how bad you feel for a few weeks. And there are plenty of resources available to you if you want to put down that cigarette.\nA great resource is the Smoke Free website, www.smokefree.gov, which provides you with tools and resources to help you stop the unhealthy habit.

Allen\nSynopses & Reviews\nThomas B. Allens expertise in military history and strategy is combined with Roger MacBride Allens knowledge of technology to reveal a lesser-known yet fascinating side of the 16th president of the United States. Their authoritative narrative reveals Lincoln as our nations first hands-on Commander-in-Chief, whose appreciation for the power of technology plays a critical role in the Norths Civil War victory over the less developed South.\nReaders meet Lincoln as he exchanges vital telegraph messages with his generals in the field; we witness his inspection of new ship models at the Navy Yard; we view the president target-shooting with the designer of a new kind of rifle; and we follow Lincoln, the man of action, as he leads a daring raid to recapture Norfolk, VA.\nThe books historic sweep also sets Abraham Lincoln in the context of his military era: we learn about the Norths Anaconda Plan, the Souths counter strategies, and how the concept of total war replaced the old Napoleonic way of fighting. Readers will come away with a rich sense of a leader who lived through one of the most exciting ages of technological and social change in America. With archival photographs, artwork, and maps, Mr. Lincolns High-Tech War brings alive a time when the railroad brought soldiers and to and from the battlefields, when hot-air balloons were used for surveillance, and when ironclad warships revolutionized naval warfare.\nThe Allens detailed study demonstrates why Lincolns appreciation of the importance of technology, his understanding of the art of war, and his mastery of military strategy were key elements in the winning of the American Civil War.\nThe only president ever to be granted a patent (for a device to lift boats over shoals), Lincoln pushed for technological advances throughout his presidency.

{"text": "How much of Ringo's drumming came out of his creativity and how much came from the other guys do you think? I only ask because every so often I read about how Paul or the others came up with an idea for the drum parts and then got Ringo to do it.\nThis is a banal answer, but I imagine it varied from song to song. He probably did receive more direction from Paul, particularly as the sixties wore on and Paul became much more definite about how he wanted his records to sound. There were probably varying degrees of give-and-take during rehearsals and recording sessions, too. Some songs were probably fairly quickly arranged and dispatched, others less so. Listening to the session tapes would surely help here.\nWhich leads to another point: for all the thousands of hours of interviews done with The Beatles, there's not all that much on the music itself. John talked about it in the 1980 Playboy interview, and Paul did the same in Many Years From Now,\nbut offhand I don't recall much else. Maybe George did, too, in I, Me, Mine\nbut I haven't seen that."}

When a crisis happens: Campus resources will be immediately overwhelmed Lines of Communication may be severely limited (radios, phones, internet access) The faster you can return your campus to normal operations, the quicker you begin the recovery process\nCase Study: Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 “Totally under-prepared” “At the time, there was no established line of communication between Parking & Transportation and University Public Relations.”\nCase Study: Virginia Tech - Richard McCoy, Parking Manager, VT “At the time…we realized that no media plan existed.” “The media WILL be here. They will be of some benefit.”\nCase Study: Virginia Tech 100s of state and federal law enforcement vehicles unintentionally exacerbated the parking and traffic situation on campus.\nCase Study: Virginia Tech 350+ News outlets and the 60-70 satellite trucks quickly overwhelmed campus parking operations.\nCase Study: Virginia Tech Must prepare for numerous grief activities and to support the “special needs” of victims and VIPs.\nCase Study: Virginia Tech Day One Crisis Management: No communication could be established with Campus Police Dismissal of Campus Personnel - Removed operational managers from decision loop “Campus roadways were in gridlock” – no movement and no parking staff could help due to lack of radio communication\nCase Study: Virginia Tech Day Two – Week Two: “Grief Activities” Observations & Lessons Learned: Need a coordination meeting at the beginning of Day Two Have a Media Parking Plan in place (written guidelines) Enhanced coordination & communication between P&T and local Police agencies Prepare for numerous off-campus mourners & sightseers to want to be at “grief site” Prepare to receive large number of unexpected and sporadic “grief volunteers”\nCase Study: Virginia Tech (“Grief Activities”, Cont.) Hosting an event with the President of the United States will halt support to everything else. Identify a location to stage a large number of personnel and vehicles for support of main campus (i.e. airport) Deploying a liaison to non-university agencies (i.e. transit) was helpful Deploying a liaison to university public relations department can be useful\nWhy crisis communications matters Panic and lack of planning will exacerbate any problem. Remember… Lives may be at risk Fallout can affect the entire campus Effects may not be short term\nPreparing for the impossible Develop communications strategies Develop scenario planning (with worst case scenarios) Have designated personnel to handle crisis communications Build media awareness at all levels within your organization\nEveryone’s got a GOAL The Media wants/needs TWO things: Access and Communication Our campus wants/needs: To maintain a reasonable flow of traffic The ability to access campus buildings Access to campus roadways and buildings for emergency responders Access to campus walkways\nCommon Sense Guidelines Anticipate Acknowledge Articulate & Communicate Do the right thing, and be seen doing it Be assertive & open No “no comment” (gives the impression that you have something to hide)\nCommon Sense Guidelines Monitor what the media is saying: How it is reported, by whom, how often, qualitative as well as quantitative, ask around, read online as well as print/television Engage with journalists: Careful, honest discussion vs. “Sales Job” Remember: There is no such thing as “Off the Record” Will the press know the boundaries?\nCommon Sense Guidelines Try to understand, THEN respond. -You don’t talk to the reporter to get rid of their questions, you talk to them to reach your INTENDED AUDIENCE. No knee jerk reactions, no set pieces, no stock comments - Don’t give anyone an opportunity to question your sincerity OR your authority Train personnel - the media WILL get answers, make sure they are YOURS - “I will have to get the answer and get right back to you.” Brief Superiors & Campus Communications Team - Keep them in the loop as much as you can\nMedia: Friend or Foe? Neither - they are impartial, and have to be The reality of impartiality: NOT! Media is intensely oppositional (ex. Investigative reporting) Media shapes public opinion - “Parking Nazi’s”, “Pariah”, or… are you… ”Service Providers”, “Parking Services” Before a Crisis: Regular interaction with the media as opposed to response driven interactions - situation reports, updates on projects, positive human interest stories Engage! (and keep a record of all interactions…)\nFirst 24 hours Create an internal operations center – hotline (if necessary), key personnel, equipment, access to people & information, open lines of communication. When formulating responses: 1.Understand the issue 2.Recognize the potentials/positions 3.Address the issue\nWhat’s in a Message? Communicate: –Core values (vision, mission) –Reputation (Services, History) –The reasons behind the action (why it is important) –Safeguards taken and due diligence measures –YOUR KEY MESSAGE –Admit any wrongdoing AND what measures will be taken for redress, –Within what time frame, and led by whom –Contact information (phone(s), fax, email, webpage)\nDo you respond at all? Will it blow over? No response = Assumption of Accuracy? Respond accordingly - response based on media monitoring, consulting superiors and campus communications team\nThe Good…The Bad...and the Ugly… Share it! What’s happened at your campus? What went well? What will you handle differently NEXT time?"}

Because there are no scientific studies that have yet tested the potential effects of the variety of types of coconut oil in Alzheimer’s, I do not suggest it.\nInstead, I do consider Axona since it provides a well-studied, pure and concentrated dose of the ketone-producing properties found in coconut oil while eliminating the multitude of triglyceride-elevating components that may be found in these products (which may worsen obesity, diabetes and additional health conditions).\nAdditionally, coconut oil is not regulated nor standardized and the amount of coconut oil a patient would need to purchase to reach the same level of caprylic triglyceride levels found in Axona could cause increased side effects and would be more expensive than a 30-day supply of Axona.\nSince Axona requires a prescription by the treating physician, it ensures that therapy will continue under medical supervision, which is an important factor in ensuring safety during use. Until further research is completed, in my clinical practice I prescribe Axona instead of coconut oil, for all of these reasons.\nRecent research shows that Alzheimer’s may be effectively managed through diet and nutrition, and these non-drug dietary approaches that balance safety with scientific evidence are essential considerations for comprehensive management.\nLast month, research was presented at the international Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s disease meeting in Monte Carlo, Monaco. My colleagues (Drs. Ochner, Barrios, Lee, Greer) and I identified clinical trials and additional studies addressing the relation between dietary practices and memory function.\nEvidence (focusing on clinical trials) surrounding the use of dietary interventions for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was rated as: Strong, Moderate, Weak or Insufficient for several dietary areas (J Nutrition Health & Aging. Vol 16:9; 9 Nov 2012).\nWe concluded that due to the lack of empirical evidence and potential for adverse effects, at this time there is Insufficient evidence (meaning, not enough research has currently been done yet to prove) for coconut oil for Alzheimer’s.\nUltimately, there remains a clear need for further scientific evaluation. For more of a direct comparison between the differences between Axona and coconut oil, view the chart below.\nRichard S. Isaacson, MD serves as Vice-Chair of Education and Associate Professor of Clinical Neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

{"text": "by Dr. G. Terry Madonna and Dr. Michael Young\nOn the campaign trail, one of Hillary Clinton's favorite quips was the one about it taking still another Clinton to clean up the messes of yet another Bush. John McCain, who will soon be running hard in Pennsylvania, isn't known to seek advice from Hillary, but he might well adapt her tidy formulation to his uphill race in the state. In McCain's case; however, both Hillary's logic and her phrase are reversed; for McCain it won't be another Clinton cleaning up the problems of a Bush, but rather adopting another Bush's political game plan to finish up what a Clinton started.\nThe Bush in this case is Bush 41, George Herbert Walker Bush, and the last Republican presidential candidate to win in Pennsylvania. And the Clinton is Hillary herself, whose April campaign against Obama in Pennsylvania revealed the Democratic presumptive nominee's grievous weaknesses among culturally conservative working class white voters. To win Pennsylvania McCain needs to pick up where Hillary ended, and he needs to follow Bush's 1988 political map to get there.\nMore specifically, the argument for McCain in Pennsylvania is three-fold:\nMcCain Needs to Win Pennsylvania\nOn paper one can fashion an Electoral College map that gets John McCain into the White House without going through Pennsylvania. Indeed, George Bush won the White House twice despite losing the state twice. But moving from paper to the real world will be a difficult proposition in this challenging political year for Republicans. Unlike either 2000 or 2004, many normally Bush states are in play-states like New Mexico, Colorado, Virginia, and Iowa, and some of them are probably going to end up in the Democratic column. This means that McCain must pick up some states that Bush lost as well as hold onto battleground states like Ohio and Florida. In fact, the tightest contests may well be in big electoral vote rich states like Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. As much as in any other battleground state, Pennsylvania voters seem ripe for a McCain pitch. Filled with working class voters worried about the economy, they are also cultural conservatives, wary of liberal Democrats, fond of independents, and historically responsive to moderate Republicans. If McCain can hold on in Florida and Ohio and pick up Pennsylvania, that would probably seal the deal for him.\nClinton Showed it Can be Done\nHillary Clinton's nine point victory over Barack Obama in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary revealed Barack Obama's dual Achilles heels in the Keystone state: geography and demography. Geographically his problems are in the western part of the state; demographically they are with blue collar working class, Catholic, senior citizen, and union voters. Senator Clinton's edge in the western counties over Obama was substantial: 79 percent in Fayette, 71 percent in Washington, 70 percent in Beaver, and 55 percent in Erie. Obama's poor performance among core Democratic constituencies in strategic Democratic counties represents a potential problem for him that transcends merely racially motivated voting. Many of these voters are conservative pro-life, pro-gun adherents, once known nationally as Reagan Democrats and in Pennsylvania itself known as Casey Democrats for those who supported Governor Robert P. Casey.\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush's 1988 Campaign Shows the Way\nThe last Republican presidential candidate to win the Keystone state was George Herbert Walker Bush, who won in a 51 to 48 percent squeaker. Whereas Clinton's 2008 win revealed the demographics receptive to a McCain candidacy, Bush's 1988 win provides the geography of a possible victory in the state.\nThe key to Bush's 1988 victory was holding onto the Philadelphia suburbs while losing only two counties, Lackawanna and Philadelphia-east of the Susquehanna. Since 1988 state population shifts have made the eastern part of the state even more important. To win Pennsylvania, Republican candidates must now hold their core base in South Central Pennsylvania around Harrisburg, win the Philadelphia suburbs, and hold down large Democrat majorities in the western part of the state and in Philadelphia.\nAlas for the GOP, this previously practiced strategy has proven more difficult to execute over the past several elections. Indeed, the problems Republicans now have winning in the East presents McCain with his most serious challenge, but also perhaps his most promising opportunity. For here McCain's maverick, self-styled independence provides him with some realistic prospect, especially in the Philly suburbs which Bush 41 last won. These are the same Philly suburbs that Obama lost to Senator Clinton. McCain's ability to attract Independent voters who live there in abundance gives him a realistic shot.\nMcCain's roadmap to victory in Pennsylvania won't be taking him onto any super highways. Instead he is going to have to walk it out region by region, county by county, and demographic by demographic-reminding suburban voters that they once liked Republicans and that he, McCain, is the kind of Republican they liked.\nIt won't be easy. Obama has a slight lead as the race begins, pegged at between two and eight points by Real Clear Politics. Moreover, Pennsylvania has only voted for one Republican for president in the past five elections. And Bush fatigue aggravated by a weak economy and Iraq make the climate for Republicans unpromising.\nThese are the conditions McCain faces as we enter the summer months. His options are few. He probably must win Pennsylvania to win the White House. Challenging as that may be, it is clearly not unthinkable for him to do it. Two months ago a Clinton showed how it could be done; twenty years earlier a Bush showed him where to do it. November will reveal if either of those lessons has been learned.\nPolitically Uncorrected™ is published twice monthly. Dr. G.

{"text": "International disputes have long been the special province of arbitration, and JAMS has promulgated a set of rules to deal with them. At the same time, the American Law Institute and UNIDROIT, the legal arm of the European community, have developed a set of uniform principles looking toward enactment by legislatures for courts. ALI/UNIDROIT, \"Principles of Transnational Procedure\" (Cambridge University Press, Eng., 2006).\nCourts may not work for most of these disputes, however, because the U.S. Constitution's Seventh Amendment guarantees that many litigants will have a right to a jury, provided they have federal jurisdiction, while the civil law rejects civil juries, as does the UK for most civil cases. Thus these principles may not be enacted, or if enacted may prove ineffective, and parties may in any event opt for arbitration. Arbitration will probably still dominate at least the near future, with some infusion from the ALI/UNIDROIT project, whose rules can be adapted for arbitration.\nThe author, who is a JAMS arbitrator and mediator, served as an American advisor for the ALI-UNIDROIT project, and found that the debates during the ALI/UNIDROIT project, combined with the procedural flexibility of the JAMS International Arbitration Rules, contain some important lessons on how parties can protect themselves procedurally when the dispute and/or the panel is transnational and JAMS administers the case. This article is about those lessons.\nConsider a procedural dispute that sharply divides Americans from their civil law counterparts: whether the lawyers or the judge initially and primarily conducts the questioning of witnesses. Civil law looks to the inquisitorial method, run by judges, but Americans think that most questioning, and particularly cross-examination, is better left to lawyers than to judges. The questioner needs a meticulous understanding of the evidence in order to test the witness's testimony effectively, and judges usually lack such knowledge. Normally they have not investigated a case the way lawyers have and know much less about its details and nuances.\nThis would be true even where a judge has studied the files, as civil law judges often do. Cross-examination also requires an instinct to pursue questionable answers, which civil law judges typically do not demonstrate. Evasions may go unexplored.\nJAMS Rule 18.2 provides that while the arbitrators have ultimate discretion, procedures will generally follow the arbitration law of the forum, unless the parties agree on another procedure. Such agreement presumably can be reached in the arbitration clause, and it is best placed there before disputes arise. Thus, when American counsel can influence the drafting of a JAMS arbitration clause, if the forum is not in the U.S. or the UK they might consider a clause that explicitly provides that the questioning of witnesses should follow the American procedure.\nMany civil law jurisdictions also prohibit counsel from interviewing and preparing non-party witnesses. This restriction is an ethical one, and is intended to prevent the coaching of witnesses. It also stems from the civil law emphasis on documentary evidence, with its concomitant downplaying of oral testimony, and the frequent absence of probing cross-examination, which American courts rely on to flush out the improperly coached witness. JAMS Rule 24.5 allows for witness preparation, subject to ethical restrictions, but such restrictions would apply in civil law countries. Problems may be avoidable through a carefully drafted arbitration clause and care in choosing the forum.\nCivil law and UK litigants usually agree to document discovery but rarely to depositions. Civil law lawyers in the ALI-UNIDROIT project, however, confessed to me that it is common to hold back important documents unless directly ordered to produce them. The arbitration clause might well provide for limited depositions to inquire into the existence of documents. It might also deal with questions about experts' neutrality.\nAs to fee shifting, many Americans consider this practice unfair to the less wealthy litigant, who is more risk averse, while civil law litigants treat it as a matter of course. The JAMS rules and most other institutions leave the question open, though the arbitrators have some flexibility to shift costs and typically international arbitrators do. Here again, early attention to the problem in the arbitration clause may save later grief and bitterness that could jeopardize future business relations.\nThese are only some of the lessons from this project. Lawyers would do well to study both the JAMS rules and the report by ALI/UNIDROIT, \"Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure,\" before drafting arbitration clauses for transnational disputes.\nPublished July 1, 2006."}

{"text": "This week, you will likely see some spooky ghosts and goblins on your doorstep. However, Halloween isn’t the only time we encounter things that scare us. Some of our fears follow us year round and try to both interfere with our time management, and inhibit us from accomplishing our goals. Unfortunately, it will take more than some free candy to make these scary things go away.\nWe strive to have excellent time management skills to efficiently work toward our goals. Sometimes, even though we know the steps we need to take in order to reach our target, we let our fears get in the way. Be careful not to let these three fears stop you from reaching your goals.\n1. Fear of The Unknown\nEven though we may be dreaming of change, the fact of the matter is, it can be a terrifying concept. The unknown is scary. Sometimes it’s easier to put off taking concrete steps toward a goal simply because the status quo is so familiar. Don’t let yourself fall into this trap. If you need help taking that first step into the unknown, look around. You probably aren’t the first one to venture down that path.\n2. Fear of Failure\nFailure is not enjoyable and in an effort to protect ourselves from that horrible feeling, we sometimes avoid trying at all. If we never try, we won’t succeed, but we also don’t run the risk of failing! This avoidance isn’t something we’re always completely aware of. A common method of failure avoidance is to busy ourselves with so many other things that we can tell ourselves we “don’t have time” to accomplish what we know is really important. Remember: we make time for what’s important to us. Failure, while painful to our ego, doesn’t have to be a dead end, but is rather a necessary pit stop on the way to success.\n3. Fear of Disappointing Others\nMany of us let other people dictate the way we spend our time. We do things not necessarily because we want to do them, but because we think it’s what others expect of us and we don’t want to let them down. Here is the thing: other people don’t care nearly as much as you think they do. People who are close to you just want you to be happy, and people who aren’t close to you are too busy worrying about how everyone else is perceiving them, that they don’t have time to judge how you’re spending your time. You need to devote your time and energy to tasks that support your own goals, not the goals of others.\nPhoto Credit: FreeDigitalPhotos.net"}
{"text": "“The Room Where It Happens” (among my favorites of the musical) actually takes us back a year from the previous two songs. It begins with Burr asking Hamilton, “Did ya hear the news about good old General Mercer?” When Hamilton responds in the negative, Burr tells him, “You know Clermont Street? They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure.” Hugh Mercer was a Scotsman who settled in Pennsylvania. During the Revolution he was a general in the Continental Army. At the Battle of Princeton (in New Jersey) on January 3, 1777, Mercer was wounded and attempted to surrender to the British. Instead of treating him as a prisoner, the British soldiers stabbed him multiple times with their bayonets, and also beat him over the head and face with the butt end of their muskets. He lingered for nine days before dying. (Hence the line, “And all he had to do was die.”) Mercer Street is located in one of the oldest areas of New York City. It runs about one mile, from Canal Street in the south to East 8th Street in the north, parallel to Broadway. It was initially called First Street prior to 1797, and then renamed Clermont Street. It was renamed for Mercer in 1799, so in reality Burr and Hamilton wouldn’t be discussing the name-change in 1790.\nAfter Burr asks Hamilton, “How you gonna get your debt plan through?” and asks for details, Hamilton dismisses Burr by saying, “I’m sorry Burr I’ve gotta go, decisions are happening over dinner.” I briefly discussed the debt plan in part eleven of this series. This dinner happened at the house Jefferson rented at 57 Maiden Lane in New York. (That building no longer stands, but there is a bronze plaque on the current building marking the “site of the former residence of Thomas Jefferson.”)\nBurr then sings, “Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room diametrically opposed, foes. They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were previously closed, bros.” Congress was debating the Assumption Bill (Hamilton’s debt plan) and the Residence Bill (where the nation’s capital should be located permanently) simultaneously. Jefferson, in a letter to James Monroe dated June 20, 1790, wrote that these were “two of the most irritating questions that ever can be raised among them” in Congress. Of the Assumption Bill Jefferson predicted that it was “probable that unless they can be reconciled by some plan of compromise, there will be no funding bill agreed to, our credit…will burst and vanish, and the states separate to take care everyone of itself.” He told Monroe, “This prospect appears probable to some well informed and well-disposed minds.” Jefferson wrote to Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. (who married his daughter) on the same day in similar terms admitting that a compromise must be reached – “The assumption must be admitted, but in so qualified a form as to divest it of it’s injustice.”\nAs for the Residence Bill, Congress was debating moving the capital from New York to Philadelphia. The delegations from the southern states were not pleased that the capital would remain in the north. For his part, Jefferson wrote Monroe, “If this plan of compromise does not take place, I fear one infinitely worse, an unqualified assumption and the perpetual residence on the Delaware.” In other words, Jefferson believed that if a compromise was not worked out, Hamilton’s debt plan would be pushed through without question and the capital would be permanently moved to Philadelphia (or some other place on or near the Delaware River in Pennsylvania or New Jersey).\nJefferson wrote his idea of a proposal to Monroe and Randolph which included “assuming to the creditors of every state a sum exactly proportioned to the contributions of the state: so that the state will on the whole neither gain nor lose” while also “fixing the temporary residence for 12. or 15 years at Philadelphia, and that at the end of that time it shall stand ipso facto and without further declaration transferred to Georgetown.”\nIt was around the same time of these letters, with both bills about to collapse, sending the new nation into chaos, that the dinner between the two Virginians – Jefferson and Madison – and an immigrant – Hamilton – took place at 57 Maiden Lane in New York City. Why were these three men alone involved in such a potentially nation-changing debate? Well, “Thomas claims” a number of things in the musical. His account of the meeting was probably written in 1792 (though maybe as late as 1794).\n- First: “Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day in distress and disarray.”\nJefferson really wrote, “The assumption of the state debts in 1790. was a supplementary measure in Hamilton’s fiscal system. When attempted in the House of Representatives it failed. This threw Hamilton himself and a number of members into deep dismay. Going to the President’s one day I met Hamilton as I approached the door. His look was sombre, haggard, and dejected beyond description. Even his dress uncouth and neglected.”\n- Next: “Alexander said, ‘I’ve nowhere else to turn,’ and basically begged me to join the fray.”\nJefferson wrote, “He asked to speak with me. We stood in the street near the door….He added his wish that I would interest my friends from the South, who were those most opposed to it.”\n- Then: “I approached Madison and said, ‘I know you hate him, but let’s hear what he has to say.’”\nJefferson wrote: “On considering the situation of things I thought the first step towards some conciliation of views would be to bring Mr. Madison and Colo. Hamilton to a friendly discussion of the subject.”\n- And finally: “Well, I arranged the meeting, I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating.”\nJefferson wrote, “I immediately wrote to each to come and dine with me the next day, mentioning that we should be alone, that the object was to find some temperament for the present fever, and that I was persuaded that men of sound heads and honest views needed nothing more than explanation and mutual understanding to enable them to unite in some measures which might enable us to get along. They came.”\nMadison, who was the only man among the three actually in the Congress, opposed Hamilton’s plan, but wanted the capital in Virginia. Burr sings, “Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee.” After being invited to dine with Jefferson and Hamilton, Madison responds “with Virginian insight,” “Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners,” and says he’ll “propose the Potomac” for the capital and “see how it goes.” Again we turn to Jefferson, who wrote that Madison suggested “that the question should be again brought before the house by way of amendment from the Senate, that tho’ he would not vote for it, nor entirely withdraw his opposition, yet he should not be strenuous, but leave it to it’s fate.” Jefferson then wrote that should assumption pass, “the pill would be a bitter one to the Southern states,” and so it was suggested by one of the three men that “something should be done to soothe them; that the removal of the seat of government to the Patowmac was a just measure, and would probably be a popular one with them, and would be a proper one to follow the assumption.”\nIn order to make the compromise happen, Madison spoke with the three men in Congress who represented the districts where the new capital would be located. Other Congressmen were likewise persuaded to switch their votes in favor of the Assumption Bill. But the move to the Potomac wouldn’t happen unless Hamilton did some wrangling as well. Jefferson believed that Hamilton spoke with Robert Morris of Pennsylvania and “obtained the vote of that state, on agreeing to an intermediate residence at Philadelphia.”\nBurr then asks Alexander, “What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?” The Compromise of 1790 moved the capital from New York City to Philadelphia, temporarily, and then to the Potomac on the Maryland-Virginia border. In the end, whether or not the men knew at the time that “it doesn’t matter where you put the U.S. capital” because the financial center of power would remain in the north (“We’ll have the banks; we’re in the same spot”), it appears Jefferson figured it out by the time he wrote this account, for he said of the compromise,\n“It was unjust, in itself oppressive to the states, and was acquiesced in merely from a fear of disunion, while our government was still in it’s most infant state. It enabled Hamilton so to strengthen himself by corrupt services to many, that he could afterwards carry his bank scheme, and every measure he proposed in defiance of all opposition…which has since been able to give laws and to change the political complexion of the government of the US.”\nAnd if poor old Aaron Burr had been in that room where it happened, would the compromise have turned out differently? Or would he still be waiting for it, whatever it is? As we see in the next song, “Schuyler Defeated,” Burr was continuing his political climb regardless.\nPhilip Hamilton opens the song saying that he sees in the paper that his grandfather, “War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr.” Schuyler, Eliza’s father, and Philip’s namesake, was a war hero, serving as a major in the French and Indian War and as a General during the Revolutionary War. Burr, however, was not a young upstart. At thirty-five (in 1791), he had already served in the State Assembly (1784-1785) and, more recently, as the State Attorney General (1789-1791), before he won the U.S. Senate seat. He served in the Senate until 1797 (when Schuyler took back the Senate seat).\nWhen Hamilton approaches Burr he asks, “Burr, since when are you a Democratic-Republican?” Burr had mostly been allied with the Anti-Federalists from the beginning, and the Democratic-Republicans were the post-Constitution reincarnation of the Anti-Federalists. They were initially formed by Jefferson and Madison in opposition to Hamilton’s policies. So when Hamilton sings, “You changed parties to run against my father-in-law,” that’s not entirely accurate.\nThe song ends on a Biblical note when Burr warns Hamilton, “I swear your pride will be the death of us all. Beware, it goeth before the fall.” Proverbs 16:18 reads: “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.”\nThat fall won’t come in part fourteen, which will cover “Cabinet Battle #2” and “Washington On Your Side,” but Hamilton’s life will start falling apart soon after."}

{"text": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are molecules that form when sugar molecules bind to proteins and lipids in the body. This process is called glycation.\nWhile glycation is a normal part of aging, it is far from desirable. AGEs contribute to cataracts, atherosclerosis, kidney failure, and even wrinkles and are implicated in the development of various diseases.\nFortunately, lifestyle changes, as well as specific nutrients, may counteract the process of AGE formation and thus help to slow the aging process.\nAGEs Increase the Risk of CancerAdvanced glycation end products also occur in the food that we eat — particularly foods cooked at higher temperatures. Glycation (or “browning”) reactions occur as proteins combine with the sugars present. For this reason, the standard Western diet contains more AGEs than are considered healthy.\nA study published in 2012 uncovered an increased risk of prostate cancer among men who ate well-done fish, by either pan-frying, oven-broiling, or grilling.1 Men who ate fish cooked at a low temperature experienced no greater risk.\nA year earlier, researchers from UCLA reported an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer in men who consumed higher amounts of hamburgers, grilled red meat, processed meat, and well-done meat.2\nAGEs are Linked to Alzheimer’s DiseaseNew research indicates that AGEs may be involved in the accumulation of amyloids, the brain plaques that characterize Alzheimer's disease.\nResearchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City, recently found a high level of AGEs, as well as amyloid-beta deposits, in the brains of mice given a diet high in AGEs.3 The adverse changes observed in the study did not occur in mice given a diet low in AGEs.\nHow to Combat AGEs with Nutritional SupplementsCutting down on meat is one way to reduce the risks associated with AGEs. Another way to reduce AGEs in the body is by consuming specific nutrients.\nBenfotiamine (a form of vitamin B1), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (a form of vitamin B6), and carnosine can reduce glycation reactions that occur in the body.\nCarnosine, which is found naturally in cells and in food, can interfere with glycation, as well as reduce the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species. It’s composed of two amino acids, beta-alanine and L-histidine.\nAGEs Put Diabetics at Increased RiskSince glycation is more prevalent in diabetics, it is recommended that diabetics undergo regular testing for hemoglobin A1c. While the test is a good marker of long-term blood glucose control in diabetics, it also provides a valuable assessment of glycation for healthy men and women.\nKeeping blood sugar under control is one way to reduce glycation in the body. For most people, this involves eating right and exercising, but for diabetics, specific medications may be required.\nThe Bottom LineAGEs can accelerate the aging process and may contribute to a number of health problems and diseases. Fortunately, by adjusting your cooking methods, eating less sugar, and supplementing with the right nutrients, you can minimize your risk. As always, prevention is the best medicine of all.

{"text": "After the repressive regime of Mullah Mohammad Omar and his Taliban zealots was swept away, Afghans would have freedom, democracy and aid to modernise their neglected, backward country.\nA decade later, the life of the majority of Afghans now stands in stark contrast to the bright vision laid out in those promises.\nTen years of foreign presence in Afghanistan have done little for 48-year-old Ghulam Rabbani Ahmadzai, or ordinary people like him, he says.\n\"We don't see any considerable changes,\" said the 48-year-old, leaning on the counter of his street restaurant and lamenting how little his life has changed. \"Aid has been misused. There has been a huge misallocation of funds. A small percentage of the top ranks have become rich but there has been no change in life for the rest of us.\n\"Millions of dollars came here and we don't know where this aid has gone. There is no infrastructure, nothing is working. They didn't use the funds in the right manner. They invested for themselves.\n\"If we had used the aid in a good way, our country would have become paradise.\" Instead only a voracious elite, many of whom are linked to Hamid Karzai's government, had benefited from the billions of pounds poured into the country, he said.\nHe added that Nato has not even been able to bring security.\nAfghans already traumatised by more than three decades of fighting see a Taliban insurgency spreading across the country despite a coalition of 48 nations ranged against it.\nThe crime and lack of punishment which plagued Afghanistan during the notorious warlord years of the 1990s are back, say many residents. Security has deteriorated in Kabul to such an extent that Mr Ahmadzai now has fond memories of the strict Taliban regime.\n\"You didn't have to worry about whether you left your door open or shut,\" he said. \"If you left a million dollars lying about no one would steal it. I am very supportive of the Taliban in that sense.\" Kidnapping by criminal gangs is also a daily hazard.\n\"If you are a millionaire, you risk being kidnapped,\" explained Mr Ahmadzai. \"If you have a handsome son or a beautiful daughter, they will be kidnapped.\" He said complaining to the local police was futile.\nThe increasing violence in Kabul - suicide bombers and rocket attacks - has also been bad for his family and for business.\n\"When there is a bomb blast, people go into hiding. No one dares to come to the bazaar; even for up to a month after an attack, no one comes to the bazaar.\"\nThe disappointment of the past decade has festered into distrust and suspicion of the West. Afghans cannot understand why the United States and Britain or their allies, with so much money and technology at their disposal, have achieved so little.\nIncreasingly many Afghans feel the only answer can be that the West is not interested in helping them and has a hidden agenda – feelings easily played upon by Taliban propaganda.\nAmong Mr Ahmadzai's greatest disappointments are the prospects for his six children. \"I am absolutely not happy about their future,\" he said.\n\"[My eldest son] is still working with me in the burger shop. My ambition was for him to become a government worker, but to do that you must graduate from college.\n\"The people who find jobs know English, know computers, and are relatives of government officials.\" He concluded: \"We are tired of the war. We need peace. It doesn't matter who the president is, we just need peace.\""}
{"text": "Chilmark will end the fiscal year with a negative cash flow and will have to borrow more than $2 million to finance operations because the state Department of Revenue (DOR) hasn’t certified the town tax rate. The DOR has lingering questions over how the town assesses some properties.\nBecause this is a revaluation year, the assessed value of many properties are going up, and the town has to go through a complicated process that involves a public disclosure period, public hearings, and distribution of impact letters to property owners.\nNormally the town has a preliminary certification from the Department of Revenue by the middle of October and can set the tax rate by late November or early December. Tax bills are normally mailed out by May 1, at the latest.\nBut this year the DOR wants to know more about how certain properties were assessed. Among other things, DOR officials have questioned how the town assessed property values in Seven Gates Farm and beach rights for properties near Squibnocket Beach.\nThe situation is complicated by the lack of home sales in the town in recent years. Normally, the record of home sales gives the DOR useful information about property values and assessments. But in Chilmark, where properties routinely sell for millions, there may be only a handful of property sales in any given year.\nIt is also difficult for the DOR to get a complete sample of the market and home valuations, since homes along the same street or in the same neighborhood may sell at vastly different prices, due to things like beach access or views.\nBecause of the questions, coupled with this being a revaluation year, the town has yet to certify its tax rate with the state. As a result, the town has already been forced to borrow $2.1 million in revenue anticipation notes, a short-term debt security issued on the premise that future revenues – in this case tax collections – will be sufficient to meet repayment obligations.\nThe town borrowed the money from the Edgartown National Bank with a rock bottom interest rate of 0.39 percent, according to town treasurer Melanie Becker. But in accordance with state law, the short-term note must be repaid by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.\nAt the regular selectmen’s meeting on Tuesday, assistant tax assessor Pam Bunker explained that the town took out the short-term loan on the premise the state would certify the tax rate in time to get tax bills out by May 1.\nMs. Bunker said the town still needs to hold public hearings regarding revaluation. The tax bills will not be out until the last week of July or the first week of August, she said. “And that’s if the state cooperates with us,” she added.\nAnd, the town may need to borrow again, not only to pay back the $2.1 million in revenue anticipation notes to the Edgartown National Bank, but also to raise additional funds to cover operating costs and pay bills through the month of July.\nAccording to Ms. Becker, the town will have to go out on the open market to borrow the money, and there is no guarantee the town will again secure an interest rate as low as 0.39 percent.\nMs. Bunker said the town has done everything it could to comply with the DOR’s request for information, including providing detailed analyses of property assessments in Seven Gates Farm and the Squibnocket area.\n“We have been consistent within the statistical constraints they requested, but they keep asking for different backup documentation, which we continually resubmit,” she said.\nEarlier this week, Ms. Bunker spoke with Marilyn Brown, the chief of local assessments for the DOR, and Robert Nunes, the deputy chief of revenue, who asked about beach rights and the recent sale of Blue Heron Farm and properties in Seven Gates Farm.\nMs. Bunker said DOR officials seem satisfied and gave the town permission to at least conduct the public disclosure process and conduct the public hearings relating to the revaluations. But because of the delays, the tax bills still won’t go out until after the start of the new fiscal year.\n“What strikes me is we are the same town we have been for the past many years, and these types of discrepancies [in assessments]have been here for years and years . . . this delay has put us in a position where we have to borrow $2 million just to pay our bills,” selectman Warren Doty said.\n“We have people calling town hall and saying, where is our tax bill, we want to pay. And we are saying, no not yet,” Mr. Doty added. “Up to now our system has been excellent, and I don’t think we need to change our system. I think we need the state to come around and cooperate, instead of doing this dance where they just keep asking us new questions.”\nTown resident Judy Jardin, also the treasurer of Aquinnah, said that town has had similar problems with the DOR, which has delayed the tax bills. “We too are getting all those calls; in fact we changed the message on the answering machine so it was just explaining what was going on,” she said.\nMs. Jardin said Aquinnah has not has the same problem with cash flow, since tax bills are sent out on a quarterly basis and not on a semi-annual basis, as is the case in Chilmark.\n“This town, we are in a world of hurt because we are going to have to borrow $2 million . . . you have a tax collector employed for 35 hours a week but only sending out tax bills twice a year. That is why most of the towns have changed for this very reason — to improve tax flow,” Ms. Jardin said.\nMs. Jardin said her understanding was that the DOR has cut back staffing, and a new person is working with town officials on the Cape and Islands, which could contribute to the questions and delays regarding the tax rate in Chilmark.\n“So we are looking like fools when in reality they are the fools,” responded Jonathan Mayhew, chairman of the Chilmark selectmen.\nMr. Mayhew said he worried the town’s cash flow problems could negatively affect its bond credit rating. “It’s just funny we just got a higher [bond]rating, and now we have this crazy brouhaha,” he said.\nSelectman Bill Rossi suggested the town send out preliminary bills based on the preliminary tax rate, to try raise revenue. But it was unclear whether it could do so legally, and selectmen agreed to seek advice from town counsel Ronald Rappaport.\nSelectmen scheduled an emergency meeting with Mr. Rappaport to discuss the possibility of sending out preliminary bills and other issues relating to the current situation surrounding the tax bills.\n“I support town counsel looking into it,” Mr. Doty said. “We need to push people and make it known that we consider ourselves a very solvent, financially stable town, and we can’t borrow money because of some paper work snafu or some disagreement over beach rights ,which only represent a small percentage of landowners in the town of Chilmark.”"}
{"text": "ESA joins UN climate talks in Kenya\nThe United Nations annual summit on climate change this week in Nairobi, Kenya, seeks to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol strategy, which becomes obsolete in 2012, to restrict emissions of heat-trapping gases that drive climate change. ESA joins the activities to share results of its satellite-based Kyoto-supporting services.\nMore than 6 000 representatives of national governments, international organisations and non-governmental organisations are present at the second meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 2), held in conjunction with the twelfth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 12) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This joint summit is taking place at the UN Office in Nairobi, Gigiri, from 6 to 17 November.\nHot on the summit’s agenda is the ‘Greenhouse Gas Data 2006’ report released on 30 October by the UN Climate Secretariat that found greenhouse emissions by industrialised countries showed a \"worrying\" upward trend in the 2000-2004 period despite the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol requires 35 industrialised nations to reduce levels of greenhouse gas emissions – chief among them carbon dioxide – by 5 percent compared to reference year 1990 between 2008 and 2012, with the European Union committed to a reduction of 8 percent.\nThe UN report states the overall emissions dropped by 3.3 percent in the 1990-2004 period but mostly because of a 36.8 percent decrease by economies in transition in eastern and central Europe; the other industrialised parties of the UNFCCC increased their emissions by 11 percent.\nAround 25 billion tonnes of extra carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere annually by human activities, mainly through wildfires, land clearance and the burning of fossil fuels. The total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a quarter since the start of the Industrial Revolution 150 years ago.\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse emissions to clear the air of excess carbon dioxide, plant growth absorbs carbon from the atmosphere, so the Protocol includes a mechanism for signatories to offset emissions against increases in the stock of carbon stored in vegetation, especially forests.\nWhat the Protocol requires for such offsetting to take place is annual reporting of land use changes – especially afforestation, reforestation and deforestation (ARD) - associated with shifts in the terrestrial carbon stock, to be carried out at the national level.\nESA has a long-standing commitment to extend the use of satellite data beyond science into operational applications, and in particular to strengthen the effectiveness of international conventions. To this end, a project called GSE Forest Monitoring (GSE-FM), which began in February 2003, integrates the most relevant and recent scientific research and monitoring practices with the latest analytical tools and information technologies aimed at detecting changes in forest area and density in order to establish baselines and projections and estimate averted emissions.\nThis operational forest and land use monitoring service is provided to the Ministries of Environment and Agriculture in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Switzerland.\nBeyond Europe, services are provided for countries, including Indonesia, South Africa, Uganda and Paraguay, and include the evaluation of Kyoto-authorised Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) afforestation to foster inward investment and sustainable development in developing countries.\nGSE Forest Monitoring is being carried out as part of the initial portfolio of services offered through Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), a joint initiative between ESA and the European Commission (EC) to build a global monitoring capability in support of Europe's environmental and sustainable development goals.\nESA will be operating an exhibit throughout this historic summit to communicate its activities developed to support the Protocol. It is demonstrating ESA’s contribution to systematic global observations for understanding climate change. Some of the variables essential for understanding and monitoring the climate system can be efficiently observed from space since this enables their systematic, global and homogeneous measurement. Several ESA global-scale projects transform satellite data into meaningful parameters that provide insight into climate change issues.\nRenewable energy has limitless resources, but harnessing its full potential requires careful management of the fluctuations in the energy source. Earth Observation (EO) from space can assist with timely information on available resources such as met-ocean conditions, solar radiation and snow water content as well as environmental factors affecting the yield such as weather conditions, land cover and surface roughness.\nThe ability of satellites to deliver synoptic information (providing spatial variability) and long-term time series from the archive (providing temporal variability) make them particularly useful to optimise energy production and complement traditional in-situ measurements, which are costly and provide only local information.\nESA is also organising a Side Event – ‘Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: can it be measured?’ – on 9 November."}

{"text": "For decades, Timex Corp. built its reputation and sales on the watch that ``takes a licking and keeps on ticking.``\nBut its business took a kicking about 10 years ago, when low-priced imports that were better looking than its plain round watches entered the U.S. market.\nTimex should have known better, according to Michael Jacobi, vice president of marketing and sales.\nThe Connecticut-based company had operated for years in Europe, where standards for product design were generally higher than in the United States. Yet it had no industrial design department, only an engineer who would look at competitors` products, then figure out how something like them could be mass- produced for Timex, Jacobi said.\nToday, Timex preaches the gospel of industrial design and the difference it can make for manufacturers trying to compete in global markets.\nA revamped line of watches, packaging and product displays is helping the company regain the market share it lost in the early 1980s to Swatch and other brands of flashy, low-priced watches.\nJacobi and John Houlihan, who heads Timex`s 15 industrial designers, spoke to the national conference of the Industrial Designers Society of America, which met earlier this month in Minneapolis.\nTimex`s transition from a manufacturing-oriented to a design-oriented company was a return to its early days, when it developed the first wristwatch worn by soldiers in World War I.\nIn the 1930s an agreement with Walt Disney resulted in Timex designing the first Mickey Mouse watch.\nBut the company became the country`s biggest watchmaker-a position it still holds-by making inexpensive watches durable enough to withstand the torture tests portrayed in the 1950s TV commercials featuring John Cameron Swayze.\nTimex`s first challenge came in the early 1970s when digital and quartz-based watches made mostly in Japan were introduced in the U.S. Later, colorful plastic watches such as the Swatch brand entered the market. Plastic previously had been used only for children`s watches, Jacobi said, and its use in fashionable adult watches represented a major change in the market.\nTimex ignored the trends until the early 1980s, when its sales had slipped for a few years. Those declines have only recently reversed as the benefits of the design programs have begun to pay off, Jacobi said. Privately held Timex does not disclose profits, but Jacobi said sales are about $500 million. That gives it about one-third of the U.S. watch market, down from about half the market before sales declined.\nToday, Timex offers spiffed-up classic watches along with newer, flashy plastic watches for teenagers and sports watches for swimmers, runners, skiers and aviators.\nBesides hiring industrial designers, the company has invested about $20 million in the last few years retooling plants to work with new materials and design components, Jacobi said.\nTimex`s profit margins have improved because it now charges up to $75 for its watches. The old utilitarian watches used to cost $10 to $20."}
{"text": "About 40 years ago, a German priest who was horrified by the liberation and, as he saw it, licentiousness of the '60s, concluded that the Catholic Church should withdraw. He imagined an embattled \"remnant\" of orthodoxy, resisting the modern world and preserving its royal structure (pope as king), its system of male privilege, and its obsession with controlling all aspects of sexuality. Thousands of other priests would find this vision appealing and work to make it real.\nAs the priests nurtured their idea of Catholicism as a moral fortress, tens of thousands of nuns considered the '60s and loved much of what they saw and heard. They saw nothing wrong with questioning authority, asserting equality and promoting peace even at the expense of their own lives. They moved past their severe and chilly stereotyped roles to work and live in the world. As they did, they paid close attention to the poor, the sick, the young, the old, the powerless and the reviled. They respected the sexual choices made by loving, consenting adults.\nSince the 1960s, the men of the remnant and the nuns of the world have continued to more in different directions. With the exception of certain politicians who would bring back the Nixon years (Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, etc.), almost everyone else has allowed the great argument of that time to cool. These two groups of Catholics, however, refused to let go. The nuns continually renewed their effort to champion the powerless, and risked their lives in the process. Since 1970s these women have been murdered in alarming numbers. The killings have occurred in El Salvador, Brazil, Liberia, Burundi, Peru, Sierra Leon and many other countries.\nFor their part, the men who feared the '60s focused first on gaining power. This effort culminated in the papacy of John Paul II. The theorist who voiced the remnant concept, Joseph Ratzinger, became his doctrinal enforcer, moving to discipline the unorthodox wherever they dwelled. In geopolitics, the men acted mainly as diplomats and charismatic leaders. They achieved great success aiding the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the early 1990s. However, since then their Church has been overwhelmed by a seemingly endless sexual abuse scandal that finds thousands of supposedly celibate men accused to violating children and teenagers. Hundreds of these men have been found guilty and sent to jail. Billions of dollars have been paid in civil settlements, and the shame has emptied churches from Dublin to Brisbane.\nCoexisting for decades, the remnant and the nuns have become identified in the public mind, with two very different versions of Christianity. One seems devoted to confronting suffering with love, grit, and action. The other dons regal vestments and issued judgments and demands from thrones and pulpits. Recently the two came into direct conflict as the enthroned men -- now led by Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI -- declared the nuns in error and demanded they bring themselves back into line.\nRecently, the nuns of the Leadership Council of Women Religious met with an archbishop named J. Peter Sartain, who represented the Vatican. As the sister's engage with the hierarchy they might consider that they, and the men who sought to preserve the remnant, now occupy the realities they once only imagined. The hierarchy of men based in Rome and ensconced in chanceries around the world is regarded with skepticism and, due to the abuse scandal, revulsion. Under their rule, Catholics the world over have become less committed to the institution. Conversely, Catholic nuns are widely respected and loved as examples of Christian devotion, selflessness and fearlessness. Faced with threats, they have received a flood of support from ordianry believers.\nSome rank-and-file Catholics hope the sisters will push back hard, knowing millions of Catholics believe they represent what is good in their religion. Others hope to the nuns will engage in an extended process with the men, which may strengthen the Church for the long haul. Whatever the sisters choose to do, they needn't fear. If they measure themselves by the values they chose to follow in the '60s, they are both successful and secure."}

{"text": "[MEXICO CITY] Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has announced plans to increase funding and policy support for science and technology in a drive to create a culture of science and aid domestic industries.\nThe government will draw up a roadmap geared towards establishing \"a new scientific culture in the country, based on academic knowledge, the strength of the private sector and governmental responsibility\", Peña Nieto said in a press release this month (4 January).\n- Mexico plans to boost S&T investment and develop science in its regions\n- Government roadmap includes pledge to boost science funding to one per cent of GDP\n- But experts warn that funding pledges are still low and reflect poor state of Mexican science\nThe roadmap, to be produced in consultation with the ministries of finance and economy, will seek to increase overall science funding to at least one per cent of GDP, and Peña Nieto said he would like to see science funding tripled.\nAlthough a 2002 law stipulated that government science funding should be one per cent of GDP, Mexico has failed to raise investment to this level. The country currently invests 0.4 per cent of its GDP in science.\nThe president's backing means the country could reach the goal within his six-year presidency by increasing science funding by 0.1 per cent of GDP each year. However, any increase will have to be approved by the country's parliament.\nThe roadmap will also seek to increase links between academia and industry; to strengthen the national system of science, technology and innovation; and to create of a foundation to raise funds for science.\nIn addition, the government will increase the number of scientists and will design individual public policies for each region and state, determined by their specific needs and capacities, with the aim of decentralising S&T development.\nPeña Nieto also promised to increase the powers of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), the main research funding agency in the country, describing it as a \"vital instrument for accelerating the Mexican state's transformation\".\nThe Scientific and Technological Advisory Forum (FCCyT), an independent governmental advisory body, welcomed the initiative in a press statement last week (9 January).\nBut it added that more private sector investment would also be needed, to strengthen the efforts to help turn Mexico into a knowledge society.\nAccording to FCCyT, Mexico's 2013 national budget had already unveiled a rise in S&T investment, with 11.5 per cent more funding being reserved for S&T than in 2012.\n\"This is the biggest increase of the last eight years and we are optimistic,\" Gabriela Dutrénit, FCCyT's general coordinator, tells SciDev.Net.\nBut \"we're still far from the annual increase of 0.1 per cent needed [to ensure] that in 2018 we reach the one per cent of GDP target, as stipulated by the law\".\nAntonio Lazcano, a biology professor at Mexico City's National Autonomous University of Mexico, and one of the country's leading scientists, also welcomes the initiative.\nHowever, he says that the one per cent goal is still \"an extraordinarily low investment percentage compared with other countries\" and is \"a reflection of how bad things have been for Mexican science in the last decades\".\nLazcano warns: \"This goal is really modest and stipulates an investment in resources insufficient to create new areas of research\"."}
{"text": "Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg called Snapchat a “super interesting privacy phenomenon,” in a discussion at Stanford University. The talk, covered extensively by TechCrunch, touched on various topics, including NSA surveillance and the lack of venture capital funding for multi-billion-dollar public projects. The introduction of privacy and disposability into social networking is an evolutionary step that Facebook is working to keep pace with, Zuckerberg said. “That’s a big kind of innovation that we’re going to keep pushing on and keep trying to do more on,” he said.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: “I was a psychology major. I just took most of the computer science classes.” pic.twitter.com/SC8jE5YTMB\n— Stanford University (@Stanford) January 15, 2014\nWhen it comes to ensuring privacy of your user base, does Facebook really need to work that hard in order to ‘innovate’? Sure you need to keep one step ahead of hackers, but privacy issues should really have been addressed from day one. Do you believe Facebook had our backs back then? If we accept the premise, that Facebook users are the product and not the customer – and given Facebook’s past track record on the issue, it seems its reaction to privacy is appeasement driven. Forgive my skepticism, but was it not alleged in a lawsuit that the tech firm spied on private messages between users and provided that data to third-party advertisers and marketers? Their interest in the private messaging space is not going away.\nIt was only a matter of time when the Stanford talk, steered towards Snapchat and privacy. Facebook of course, tried unsuccessfully to acquire the startup in a deal worth $1billion. Here is what Zuckerberg had to say:\n“I think Snapchat is a super interesting privacy phenomenon because it creates a new kind of space to communicate which makes it so that things that people previously would not have been able to share, you now feel like you have place to do so. And I think that’s really important and that’s a big kind of innovation that we’re going to keep pushing on and keep trying to do more on and I think a lot of other companies will, too.”\nZuckerberg did not directly acknowledge the fact that Facebook users feel less comfortable sharing on Facebook or that teens are abandoning the platform since the social network recently made most users searchable on the site. He did say that Facebook will keep working on allowing people to communicate in a private space, which probably means that they will shrug off the failure of Snapchat clone killer- Poke and come up with future “innovations” where it is more about what they can leverage as a company and less about you.

{"text": "Holding Your Baby\nYou will spend lots of time holding your baby—to comfort her, to move her from one place to another, and just to enjoy being close to her. This is one of the ways you and your husband bond with your baby. Go ahead and let friends and family hold your baby as well. It's important that she come to know all the people in her life from an early age.\nPlagiocephaly is a condition in which a baby develops a flat spot on the back or side of her head from too much pressure there. This usually happens if a baby spends every night and too many hours of the day lying in any one position. To help prevent this, carry your baby using a variety of different holds and promote tummy time during play periods. If your baby does develop a flat spot, take her to the pediatrician right away.\nYour baby will likely be given to you to hold close to your body as soon as she is born. This is because skin-to-skin contact with you has important benefits, including warming her and helping her to regulate her breathing. However, this contact is not only important on the day of birth; its value holds true throughout infancy. So, take some time each day to hold your baby close to your bare skin during those first few months. Your baby will enjoy the warmth of your body and the sound of your heartbeat, and you'll love the soft sensation of contact with your baby.\nDads should also take time to enjoy skin-to-skin contact with their babies. A mother already has a deep connection with her child from giving birth, and skin-to-skin contact can help a father establish a similarly strong relationship with the baby. In a parent's arms, a baby feels completely safe and comfortable.\nHolding a baby comes quite naturally to most new mothers. It's likely that you will inherently know which body parts need the most support. However, there is more than one way to hold your baby. Some holds are one-handed, allowing you to use your free hand for something else. Some holds give the baby a view of the world around him, and others give him a direct view of your face.\nThough you will surely discover other useful options through your experience as a parent, here are a few basic holds you can use with your baby:\nCradle Hold: This position is commonly used for nursing. Your baby's head goes in the crook of your arm, and you extend your forearm along the baby's back, supporting her bottom with the palm of your hand.\nShoulder Carry: This hold is great for calming a fussy baby. Just rest your baby's head on your shoulder, hold the baby's lower back and bottom with that arm, and stabilize the baby's head with your other hand.\nFootball Hold: With your dominant hand faceup and at your side, place the back of your baby's head in your palm and support her body with your forearm, holding her close to the side of your body. This is a great position for nursing after a cesarean because the baby is not hovering around your scar.\nHip Carry: This position is for older babies who can hold up their own heads. Rest your baby's bottom on your hip bone so she is facing outward and wrap that arm around the baby's body. This keeps your other arm totally free for another task.\nFrom The Everything Mother's First Year Book Copyright © 2005, F+W Publications, Inc.

{"text": "SEMINOLE — Mary Urquhart was at the barn before sunrise. Getting up early to feed the horses is nothing unusual for the 80-year-old, but Saturday was special.\nTwenty-three disabled athletes were due by 8:30 for the Special Olympics Florida Area 6 Equestrian Competition.\nAs the event got under way, sunlight filtered through the pines, lighting athletes' faces as they stepped or were helped into the saddle.\nRiders' disabilities and abilities dictate whether they need a person called a side-walker to walk alongside the horse to keep riders safely in the saddle. Some riders lack muscle control. One was blind.\nEach horse also is led by a horse handler, usually a young volunteer from 4-H, Girl Scouts or local high schools.\nAccording to Urquhart, director of the Pinellas Kiwanis Horses for Handicapped riding program, handlers must not interfere with the directions given by the rider.\nJenny Mazgaj understands what goes on behind the scenes with the horses. She helps Urquhart daily at the barn, writes the group's newsletter, maintains the website and sits on the board.\n\"I'm here as a support team for my two disabled daughters, Nina and Katie,\" said Mazgaj, of Seminole. \"The twins have participated as disabled riders since 2005.\"\nRiders were judged on equitation (riding style), postures and control of the horse as they walked around a riding ring. Then it was on to an obstacle trail with eight challenges, including barrel jumping for more independent riders.\nThe regional leads to the state competition at the State Fairgrounds in May.\n\"We sent eight riders last year,'' Urquhart said. This year's number won't be decided until slots are allotted according to a lottery in a few weeks.\nSt. Petersburg resident Steve Colbert's daughter, Madeline, won in equitation and was second in trail.\n\"We've seen such a great improvement in her strength and balance,\" Colbert said. \"She thrives on the horses and the therapy.\"\nRyan Feeley, 16, waited to compete in pole bending, where horse and rider weave in and around set poles.\n\"When he started 12 years ago, his feet couldn't reach the stirrups,\" said his mother, Carol. \"Now he'll ride independently. The program's gotten him past his sensory integration issues. It used to be he couldn't walk on shiny floors or enter elevators. He thought he'd fall through the cracks.\"\nEquine therapy has been proven to help with sensory, motor, physical and neurological issues.\nJohn and Margo Evans of Clearwater smiled as their son Chris held tightly to his blue ribbons.\n\"One of the hardest parts (of the competition) is removing an object from the mailbox and riding over to put it in another,\" said Urquhart. \"That and placing rings on poles. In both they have to control their hands and get the horse close.\"\nUrquhart has overseen three Special Olympics regional competitions, but has directed the Kiwanis Horses for Handicapped program since its inception more than 32 years ago. It is Pinellas County's oldest free riding program for disabled adults and children.\nThe Special Olympics regional competition brought athletes from as far away as Sumter County.\n\"I personally find this one impressive event — watching how our athletes not only conduct themselves while riding, but watching how they handle the horses,\" said David R. Haines, county coordinator for Special Olympics-Pinellas County. \"This is such a different sport as opposed to, say, soccer or basketball, because there is so much more to be aware of when you place our athletes on top of 2,000-plus pounds of animal.\"\n\"This is a big event for all of us,\" Mazgaj said. \"We prepare our riders all year long, training them to be comfortable first by brushing a horse. ... They learn how to work with a horse and ride.\"\nSaturday, as she has in the past, Urquhart watched the fruits of her and so many volunteers' labor blossom as riders mounted horses, stronger and more confident than when they brushed their first pony.\n\"Just to see the transformation in my son is amazing,\" Dan Feeley said. \"When Ryan got here he couldn't get on a pony. Now he rides with no lead walker. All by himself. He's more confident. This program and competition make kids proud.\""}

{"text": "The joys of childbirth are among the highest highs a person can experience in this life. But, with the human condition being what it is, even these wonderful moments are tinged with anxiety at the thought of bringing something so precious and delicate into the world. Too often parents are forced to deal with the agony of an infant’s health issues, whether permanent or temporary. While many of these health issues cannot be blamed on anyone, there are some cases where a neonatal condition is caused directly or indirectly by medical practitioners failing to conform to a reasonable standard of care. Erb’s palsy is one such condition that may justify medical malpractice claim.\nWhat Is Erb’s Palsy?\nErb’s palsy is a condition that affects one to two newborns out of every 1,000 born in the United States, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The condition is also known as shoulder dystocia or brachial plexus palsy, and it occurs as the result of injury to the arm’s major nerves. When these nerves are damaged, the arm loses sensation and motor function.\nWhat Causes Erb’s Palsy?\nBy far, the most common cause of Erb’s palsy is difficulty during labor. When medical practitioners tug or pull the child through the birth canal, it can cause strain on the nerves, which are particularly prone to damage during the infant stage. There are several different ways this can happen. When a baby is born feet-first, the delivering doctor may pull from the feet, which may cause the baby’s arms to go up over the neck in an unnatural and harmful way. When the baby is born head/crown-first, the doctor may tug on the head, which may similarly strain the fragile nerves. Doctors are charged with a duty to care for both the mother and the unborn child, which requires them to provide competent and attentive care in all situations. A child developing Erb’s palsy may indicate that the doctor’s actions fell below this duty of care.\nHow Will an Erb’s Palsy Lawsuit Help My Child?\nWhile Erb’s palsy can be a permanent condition, in many cases, it can be overcome with therapy. A medical malpractice lawsuit can seek compensatory damages to help cover the cost of therapy and, in the most severe cases, surgery, to help the child recover from Erb’s palsy and regain full use of their arms.\nIf your child has been diagnosed with Erb’s palsy, it may be a good idea to consult with an attorney to see if you have a case. Compensation won through medical malpractice litigation can be a huge help to families facing steep medical bills to treat this largely preventable condition. At Leav & Steinberg LLP, our attorneys regularly handle medical malpractice claims, including Erb’s palsy claims, and we can advise you on your case. Contact us to schedule a free consultation."}

{"text": "HARTFORD, Conn. — Connecticut gun owners are rushing to register certain firearms and ammunition that will be considered illegal contraband in the new year.\nPeople have been lining up early in the morning at the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection's headquarters in Middletown in recent days to turn in applications for assault weapons certificates and high-capacity magazine declaration forms so they can legally keep the items.\nUnder a wide-ranging gun control law, passed earlier this year in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in Newtown, gun owners have until Tuesday to submit the paperwork.\nMichael Lawlor, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's undersecretary for criminal justice, predicted a flood of registrations over the final days of 2013.\n\"It sounds like a lot of these folks were holding off on doing it in anticipation of a potential decision or something,\" Lawlor said, referring to pending legal challenges to the state law, which expanded the definition of assault weapons in Connecticut to include more banned weapons. The law also bans the sale or purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Like the newly defined assault weapons, existing magazines can be kept so long as they're registered with the state.\n\"One thing is clear,\" Lawlor said. \"If you haven't registered it, on the following day, it is completely illegal contraband\" starting on Jan. 1.\nThe Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which is participating in a legal challenge of the new law, has been working to remind gun owners that the deadline to register and declare the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines is approaching quickly.\n\"Many people are still not aware of the law itself, or the actual date of implementation,\" President Scott Wilson said. \"While CCDL wholeheartedly believes that this law is unconstitutional, we want to make sure that law-abiding gun owners do not become felons on Jan. 1.\"\nWilson said his organization is particularly concerned that people may not be aware they're affected by the law because many handgun magazines and semi-automatic rifle magazines with a capacity to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition were sold standard along with guns before April 4, the last day people could legally purchase or sell those weapons and magazines in Connecticut. There are exceptions for members of the military, law enforcement and others.\nWilson has estimated there may be as many as 20,000 weapons in Connecticut affected by the new law.\nLt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said the agency is trying to make the process as smooth as possible for those looking to register their weapons and magazines. For example, notaries have been stationed at the DESPP headquarters to assist applicants. To obtain an assault weapon certificate, gun owners need to submit proof such as a valid sales receipt that they purchased the weapon before April 4. They also can submit a sworn affidavit that must be notarized.\nThe application requires information such as the individual's name, address, telephone number, motor vehicle operator's license, sex, height, weight and thumbprint, as well as information about the weapon, including the serial number, model and any unique markings.\nThe large-capacity magazine declaration form includes much of the same information, including the applicant's address and driver's license number.\nUnder the new law, the registered large-capacity magazines can be kept fully filled at the owner's home. They can also be taken to a licensed shooting range or gun club and filled to capacity there. Ultimately, advocates hope the law will prompt people to turn in the magazines.\n\"I think over time, there's just going to be fewer and fewer of those in circulation,\" Lawlor said.\nrelated articles »\nWASHINGTON — The gunman in the mass shootings at the Washington Navy Yard, Aaron Alexis, had a history of violent ...\nA 50 percent federal tax on ammunition and a 20 percent federal tax on guns — up from 11 percent ...\nWASHINGTON — Several times every day, at airports across the country, passengers are trying to walk through security with loaded ...\nWASHINGTON — Barack Obama once said it was a “scandal” that then-President George W.

{"text": "The International Teamster Women's Caucus was an idea developed at the 1991 Constitutional Convention. Teamster women expressed many of their issues, concerns and needs to Arlene Mordasini, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 911.\nIn the fall of 1991, a group of Teamster women from across the United States and Canada met in Boston to plan the International Teamster Women's Caucus.\nThey didn't have all the answers about how to form a caucus of this type, and there certainly was a diversity of opinions. The one common link was a need for such a caucus to address Teamster women's involvement and recognition at all levels of the organization. The union needed an advocacy group to educate and communicate with its women. Over the course of several meetings, the group established an executive board, bylaws and goals.\nIn 1995, at the one and only convention of the ITWC, Cheryl Johnson from Local 20 was elected to the position of President to replace Mordasini, who was retiring. Johnson and the executive board met quarterly and collected funds from locals and Joint Councils. With their goals and ideals in place the group persisted under the direction of General President Jim Hoffa and was successful in organizing the annual Women’s Conference, which is an important function for all Teamster women. The Women’s Conference allows women the opportunity to network, learn, and get help with issues facing them today, not only in the workplace but in everyday life as well.\nThrough the years, Johnson has been instrumental in promoting women’s issues, bringing inequalities to the forefront to be dealt with, and in mentoring other women so they could advance. When the Women’s Conference became such a popular annual event, the Women’s Caucus decided to blend its efforts with that event. The two organizations worked in unison as an avenue of communication among women.\nIn order to re-establish the ITWC as an independent organization, Johnson and the board of the ITWC decided it was time to turn over the reigns. At the 2008 Women’s Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the remaining members of the ITWC became our mentors as they passed the torch to a new crew of women to head the ITWC. The bylaws were rewritten and a smaller executive board was elected.\nWe are a seven-member board from across the U.S. and Canada. Our officers are: Diane Helf, President (Local 20); Rachel McKibbin, Secretary-Treasurer (Local 231); Margie Brignoni, Recording Secretary (Local 63); Mary Bronson, First Vice President (Local 745); Brigitte Sottile, Second Vice President (Local 804); Vivian Garcia, Trustee (Local 986); and Betty Rose Fischer, Trustee (Local 538).\nAs we re-organize the ITWC, our goals and ideals are the same as they were in the beginning. The new ITWC board is currently working on membership, web site, funding and becoming “information central” to the working women of the Teamsters Union. We hope to grow and continue the great work of the past leadership of ITWC. To check us out, look for our booth at the Women’s Conference or www.itwc.info."}

{"text": "- Erin Graver\nGrowing An Instinct for Beauty\nI am a bookworm, raising a flock of bookworms (what is the term for a group of worms? A…. squiggle? A squiggle of bookworms?) after me. I was an only child, spent a lot of time in silence, and I read a lot. Possibly, one of the best gifts my parents gave me was a lot of good books. I have in front of me right now a copy of The Velveteen Rabbit, illustrated by Michael Hague. This book made its appearance on my fireplace one Christmas morning long ago, and I pored over it. At that time, I had a ragged bear named Winston whom I loved with something approaching ferocity, and a story about a faded-but-loved rabbit made perfect sense to me.\nNow, decades later, my toddler carries around Winston (who was resurrected out of a box in my mother’s home) and I read the same copy of The Velveteen Rabbit to my children. It’s a tender story, and the paintings which accompany it are so life-like that they embody the theme of the story – love is creative, it bestows life-giving blessing into others’ hearts, and it makes Real things that before… were not. What we love, what we give our time to, creates who are at our core. As children, when we spend time looking at books that are beautiful, we are learning and practicing a certain way of engaging with reality which we then carry with us and use to engage all Reality.\nWhat kind of way? A way that is receptive, contemplative, and loving. I think we can trust beauty to teach us that, even (especially) to young children. I want my children to approach their experiences in life the way they approach a book– and how is that? They receive it– take time to notice the images and meaning in front of them. They contemplate it– compare what they have noticed with their own knowledge and experiences. They love it– they delight in it and look for what is beautiful in it. I suppose you could say that I hope my children learn to “read” a walk in the woods, a struggle in school, or the face of a stranger the way they would a book: receive it, contemplate it, even love it.\nThese are big goals for a simple picture book, and I freely acknowledge that more is required to raise a truly human being than reading beautiful books to them. But I have seen some encouraging results stemming from this education-by-beauty. If you, like me, think that raising a child who can be stopped still by the glory of a sunset is a worthy goal, then let’s continue together to note some principles which we can use to identity an excellent picture book.\nI will propose an “example book” for every principle, each of them loved well and long in my own family. I will also note in brackets the age at which I started reading these books to my own children, in case that is helpful– please know that most of these books go on to appeal to a wide range of ages.\nThe more human the art is, the better. When you flip through a book, considering if you should buy it or bring it home from the library, try asking: Could a computer easily generate these images? How much human investment of time and artisianship was necessary on the part of the artist/illustrator? When you look at a picture that was a time-consuming creation from a person who cares about the story they're telling with it, you are entering a relationship with the artist as well as the art itself. Computers don’t have this reciprocity. The pictures our children view, whether on a screen or in a book, will fill up their imaginations, which are really a sacred space in a way. These images should be worthy of our children. Two examples of this principle are:\nMr. Rabbit and the Lovely Present by Charlottle Zolotow/Maurice Sendak [3 years+]\nWhen I was Young in the Mountains by Cynthia Rylant [4+]\nNote: there are some interesting and beautiful abstract illustrations out there-- however, I think that pictures which carry a more human touch are preferable for young children for several reasons. Also, my own children simply have never fallen in love with a book illustrated abstractly, and they are my chief source of data.\nIllustrations should invite our attention, instead of grabbing it. I get the feeling that some books were illustrated so that children who have been raised on the constantly-changing images of ipads and television will sit still long enough to hear the words, or to convince new readers, with a sort of desperation that “READING IS FUN!” Good illustrations aren’t desperate; they aren’t insecure about their importance. We do not welcome these types of books into our home– the ones that are a jumble of text and colors. We do, however, welcome richly-detailed books into our home. These books are not busy, they’re detailed. They reward sustained attention and thereby encourage it. Two examples of this principle are:\nAlfie Gets In First by Shirley Hughes. Here’s a detail I enjoy: as the family enters the home, a problem arises and a ruckus ensues– notice the cat which, in previous pages, was peacefully napping on the column, turn an indignant look at the family and then jump down to find a better resting spot. [2+]\nThe Owl and the Pussycat by Jan Brett. The text is a poem from the 1800’s by Edward Lear that is fun to memorize with your kids. Apparently, Lear invented the term “runcible”, which in this book describes a spoon. Its meaning is unclear or perhaps non-existent! In other poems, he refers to a runcible cat and a runcible goose. All Jan Brett’s books are packed with detail. [2+}\nThe art in a book should deepen our experience of the story. The artwork in a book should help us more deeply understand the story/message. Images and text have a symbiotic relationship, so that each is richer because of the other. Two examples are:\nAngus and the Cat by Marjorie Flack [1 ½ +]\nStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost/Susan Jeffers. The text of this book is also a poem. My older elementary children first memorized the poem, then had the delight of finding it illustrated. Its quiet hues help us enter into the scene described in the poem and add silent details and explanations to the words of the poem. [4+]\nWhatever the materials or style demonstrated in the pictures, they should be executed with technical skill. Even if I value the text of a book, or even if it is a gift, I typically do not keep it if the pictures do not show artistic mastery– the ability to use texture and color with good effect, the ability to draw figures from different angles, and so on. You have permission (from me) to get rid of books you do not think are worthy. Go ahead! Stories that are true or good deserve beautiful pictures to go with them, and risk having their value dismissed because of poorly done artwork. What I hope is that by filling my home with books that are beautiful, I am giving my children a standard by which to judge other images and experiences in their life. They are growing a gut-level instinct for beauty with every picture they view. Two examples of this principle are:\nThe Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse by Beatrix Potter Her artistic skill is able to make animals look completely realistic as they sweep the floor, dance a jig, or do blatantly UNrealistic actions. My children love this story and always are annoyed by the intrusive neighbor. [2+]\nBlueberries for Sal by Robert McCloskey. This is a good example of how a high standard of artistic skill does not mean the same style for each book. These pictures are very different from Beatrix Potter - much less realistic, but no less masterful. [2+]\nIllustrations ought to be an appropriate and purposefully-chosen match for the kind of story they accompany and for the target age of the child. Simple illustrations are easier for a very young child to understand. For this age, I prefer pictures that are not too full of detail – they often have the background of a picture almost empty (a perfect example of that is the Little Bear series by Else Minarik/Maurice Sendak). As children grow, they are better able to appreciate illustrations chock full of detail. Art should also match the feel and tone of the book. Two other example are:\nOne is One by Tasha Tudor Her pictures are charming and lovely, a perfect match for the whimsical, nostalgic tone of her books. [1 ½ +]\nEmpty Pot by Demi This story, set in China, contains illustrations with the type of art you might see on a porcelain ginger jar, with clean pictures and deeply tinted colors. All Demi’s books are gorgeous. [3+]\nLet us joyfully take on this incredibly profound (and incredibly easy, I think) task of inviting our children to receive, contemplate, and love what is Real as they encounter it in books and beyond.\nWhat principles would you add to my list? Do you have the perfect example for one of the principles? I’m always learning and would love to hear!\nErin Graver lives in a village-within-a-city in Kansas surrounded by books, daughters, oak trees and friends.

{"text": "Each week, printing presses vomit reams upon reams of biographies and memoirs about the rich, the famous, and a dubious combination of the two (hello, Paris Hilton!). Publishers know readers love to immerse themselves in the lives of Those Who Are Not like the Rest of Us. For the space of a few hundred pages, we vicariously lap up the titillating adventures of French chefs, Revolutionary War heroes, golf pros, not-old-enough-to-vote pop singers, and White House press secretaries. But what of the humble, blue-collar American? What modern Boswell will write of the average life in as careful detail as others would of John Adams or Gene Simmons?\nAlexandra Fuller has done just that in The Legend of Colton H. Bryant, an account of a Wyoming roughneck’s short, happy life. Just as she did in her own memoirs of life in Africa, Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight and Scribbling the Cat, Fuller tells Colton’s story in a parade of impressionistic scenes that are as much about the landscape as they are about the wide-eyed oil rigger who walks through it. In the book’s opening sentences, Fuller writes: “This is the story of Colton H. Bryant and of the land that grew him. And since this is Wyoming, this story is a Western with a full cast of gun-toting boy heroes from the outskirts of town and city-shoddy villains from head office.”\nColton, the unlikely hero at the center of the book, is no John Wayne, no Gary Cooper. Raised in the Upper Green River Valley of Wyoming, he loves hunting and fishing, idolizes his father (also an oil rigger), swigs Mountain Dew by the gallon, marries young, drives a Ford pickup, and works hard to provide for his family. There’s nothing flashy or extraordinary about this Wyoming boy, and his biographer plays it straight nearly every step of the way. Fuller writes with a colloquial style, as if she’s talking her way through a story with readers as rapt listeners. It’s a quality that’s been heightened and refined since her equally pitch-perfect Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight. Now, stepping outside of her own life, Fuller bottles the essence of a young American male pitted against the unforgiving landscape where “a person could evaporate?.hide in the snow-blown creases that make up the endless quality of Wyoming’s open spaces. You might look all your life and never find a man.”\nFuller found her man several years ago while doing research for a New Yorker article about the social, economic, and environmental impact of the natural gas industry. She couldn’t have found a better David to provide contrast with Goliath-sized oil companies. Despite the “legend” of the title, Colton is not larger than life, just larger than his own life. Energetic, unflappable, and recklessly brave, he bounces through the book like a human pinball. Though he’s never officially diagnosed, he exhibits all the signs of attention deficit disorder. Fuller tells us his brain works\nlike a saddle bronc, fired up for eight seconds maximum and then bolting around the rails looking for a way out of the arena. Even on Ritalin, Colton has a way of tearing out of the chute, firing with all hooves at once. Colton doesn’t have the gear between flat out and stopped. He doesn’t have speed perception — the way other people feel alarmed when they’re going too fast, Colton feels alarmed when he isn’t moving fast enough.\nIn this way, he packs a big life in a short span of time, arms flailing, legs pinwheeling, taking chances where a more reasonable person might hesitate, always plunging forward like a horse out of the rodeo chute.\nHis simple kind-heartedness may eventually grate on cynics’ nerves or readers who want a little shadow with their sunny characters. However, by the end of the book, no matter how hard or soft your heart, it’s hard to shake Colton from your mind. If nothing else, the golly-gee expression “Holy cow!” will stick in your head like a skipping record, as will Colton’s favorite phrase: “Mind over matter — I don’t mind so it don’t matter.”\nIn drawing Colton and other characters, Fuller displays her allegiance to the spirit of Charles Dickens; the book delivers full-fleshed portraits (bordering on caricatures) which in the same breath tell us as much about the inner person as the outer appearance. Here, for instance, is her verbal snapshot of Colton’s father:\nIt would be a clich? and also not entirely accurate to say that Bill looks weather-beaten, because he doesn’t look beaten by the weather, or by anything else. So it might be better to say that Bill is a man uncovered by weather — blown and rained and sunned and snowed — to the essence of himself, more and more perfectly grained with every passing year. Stripped of unnecessary flesh in this way, he hangs faultlessly on his own bones, so self-contained that he couldn’t lose his fundamental nature even if everything else were lost.\nSometimes, Fuller’s sheer exuberance for description gets sloppy and sentimental, such as when she writes of Colton’s “cornflower blue eyes, forgiving as Jesus, like he truly couldn’t feel the pain.” It’s already enough that Colton is unbelievably pure-hearted — we don’t need the messianic comparison.\nMore than anything, The Legend of Colton H. Bryant is a story about the crushing realities facing blue-collar westerners, the once-proud pioneers who now find themselves the disposable commodities of industry and corporate greed. Colton is trapped by his circumstances, above which he’ll never rise by luck, higher education, or football scholarship. Colton is an oil rigger’s son destined to follow in his father’s greasy footprints, knowing he has little if any choice in the matter.\nFrom the opening page, Fuller warns us her subject is predestined for an early death: “Like all Westerns, this story is a tragedy before it even starts because there was never a way for anyone to win against all the odds out here.” Fuller doesn’t completely bring the “villains” on stage until the end of the book, when Colton lies dying in the hospital. An oil company safety officer pays the grieving family a visit, heartlessly telling them, “If the boy dies, we can help with the funeral, but we got to get blood and urine outta him and test for drugs. He comes up hot for anything and you ain’t getting nothing.” Fuller wisely resists injecting any authorial moralizing and just lets the scene play out on its own.\nThe most poignant chapter is saved for the end of the book: the story of Colton’s birth in the front seat of a 1976 Ford Thunderbird going 70 miles per hour on Highway 6 near Payson, Utah. In his mother’s arms, “Colton pulls away and begins to paddle, as if trying to feel the limits of his new world and, finding none, trying to swim away on his own umbilical pull back to the earth.” The image captures perfectly the sense of a boy who could not wait to start living. This is one unforgettable American life, cut short by tragedy, written in large, beautiful strokes of the pen."}
{"text": "- REAL ESTATE EDUCATION\n- MEMBER SPOTLIGHT\n- GIVING BACK\nCITY LAND --REBNY Issues New Report on Landmarking and Housing Production\nJuly 2, 2014\nREBNY report shows that housing production, particularly affordable housing, is drastically lower in landmarked areas in the five boroughs. In 2013, the Real Estate Board of New York conducted a study which showed that nearly 28 percent of Manhattan is landmarked and that fewer than 2 percent of new housing units built in Manhattan over a ten-year time period (2003-2012) were constructed on landmarked properties. On July 1, 2014, REBNY released a new report which analyzed properties and new housing activity in the other four boroughs over the same time period. REBNY found that although there are not as many landmark designations as in Manhattan, the creation of housing and affordable housing is also “sharply curtailed on landmarked properties located in those boroughs.”\nREBNY found that 3.64 percent of the City as a whole is landmarked either as individual landmarks, or more commonly, as part of historic districts. REBNY’s report shows Manhattan having the highest proportion of landmarked properties at 27.71 percent and Staten Island having the smallest proportion of landmarked properties of .32 percent. The percentage of properties that are landmarked is much higher is certain neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. REBNY’s report attributes the high percentages to the result of the “proliferation of historic districts throughout the City.” REBNY also notes that designation of historic districts are becoming increasingly prevalent in neighborhoods outside of Manhattan with 79 percent of properties designated from 2003 to 2013 being from the outer boroughs. REBNY stated that if the landmarking practices of the last ten years continue it will only be a matter of time before the landmark percentages in the other boroughs approach those of Manhattan."}

{"text": "Billy Joel ranks among rock and roll’s most talented musicians and accomplished songwriters.\nHis classical training and reverence for Broadway musicals have been counterpointed by his early grounding in the Long Island bar-band scene and his love of rhythm & blues, resulting in an enthusiastic yet musically sophisticated approach to rock and roll. His diverse influences include Beethoven, the Beatles, Dave Brubeck, George Gershwin, Phil Spector, Ray Charles and Fats Domino, whom Joel inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986.\nFrom romantic balladry to hard-rocking material, with elements of jazz, pop and soul thrown into the mix, Joel has applied his skills in a diversity of settings. He is the pop crooner of “Piano Man” and the jazz-tinged romantic of “Just the Way You Are.” Yet he’s also capable of harder-rocking fare (Glass Houses), production-heavy pop with a Sixties influence (The Nylon Curtain) and vocal-group soul and doo-wop (An Innocent Man).\nAs an artist, Joel has stated that his goal is to make music that “meant something during the time in which I lived...and transcended that time.” Joel’s popularity is such that he tied the Beatles for the most multi-platinum albums in the U.S. With the success of “Piano Man\"-a slice-of-life autobiography, written about Joel’s extended gig as a lounge pianist-Joel inaugurated a staggering run of hit singles. Between 1974 and1993, Joel placed at least one single in the Top Forty in every year but three. To date, 13 of Joel’s 42 hits have made the Top Ten, and three of them-\"It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me” (1980), “Tell Her About It” (1983) and “We Didn’t Start the Fire” (1989)-reached #1.\nBilly Joel was born on May 9, 1949, in the Bronx. He displayed an early aptitude on the piano and began taking lessons at four. The training continued till he was sixteen, by which time Joel was already a veteran of three bands. In 1967, Joel joined the Hassles, a popular Long Island group that played blue-eyed soul with a twist of psychedelia. Gravitating back to the acoustic piano during the early stirrings of the Seventies singer-songwriter movement, Joel recorded Cold Spring Harbor, his debut as a solo artist. In a self-penned bio included with review copies, Joel wrote: “After seven years of trying to make it as a rock star, I decided to do what I always wanted to do-write about my own experiences.”\nAfter the album flopped, Joel dropped out of sight, working as a lounge pianist in Los Angeles. He immortalized that experience in “Piano Man,” which served as the title track from his first album for Columbia Records. (He remains with the label to this day). His next album, Streetlife Serenade (1974), included “The Entertainer,” a withering portrait of the music industry. On Joel’s fourth album, the self-produced Turnstiles (1976), the singer/pianist stretched himself as a songwriter and stylist on a varied set that ranged from the Brill Building pop of “Say Goodbye to Hollywood” to the cabaret-styled tribute to his home turf, “New York State of Mind.” Joel made his commercial breakthrough with The Stranger, a hit-studded album that surpassed Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water as the top-selling album in Columbia’s history (until Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the U.S.A. displaced it in the Eighties). With its jazzy sheen and compositional cunning, Joel hit his stride on The Stranger, which yielded “Just the Way You Are,” “Movin’ Out (Anthony’s Song)” and the suite-like “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.” Its followup, 52nd Street, produced another round of hits, including the hard-rocking “Big Shot.”\nBeneath their fluid, polished surface, Joel’s songs teem with a New Yorker’s brashness. Joel had boxed with his fists as a teenager and, on occasion, with his songs as an adult-no more so than on 1980’s Glass Houses. Its chart-topping first single, “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me,” rebutted punk and New Wave acts who’d taken potshots at perceived old-wavers like Joel. This further inflamed a war of words with his detractors in the rock press. However, the critics came around to Joel’s corner on the strength of such albums as The Nylon Curtain, which couched social themes in ornate pop productions inspired by the late-period Beatles, and An Innocent Man, his fond tribute to the doo-wop era. Greatest Hits Volume 1 & Volume 2, a double album that collected his singles, became Joel’s seventh consecutive Top Ten album.\nJoel further refined his craft on The Bridge (1986) and Storm Front (1989)-mature later works on which he assimilated various genres into a cohesive personal style. Joel’s historic tour of the Soviet Union in 1987 resulted in a live album and video. Joel also turned a history lesson into a hit single with his rapid-fire recitation of 20th-century names and places in “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” from Storm Front. Both single and album reached #1, as Joel’s superstar status remained unabated despite ongoing shifts in musical trends. His marriage to and divorce from model Christie Brinkley, along with various business-related lawsuits, raised his profile as a celebrity and newsmaker. In 1993, Joel released River of Dreams, his first album of new material in four years, which entered Billboard‘s album chart at #1.\nSubsequently, Joel has toured with Elton John and on his own. He also has lectured on college campuses, released Greatest Hits Volume III and composed instrumental pieces in a classical vein. Joel has remained in a state of semi-retirement as a pop songwriter and recording artist since River of Dreams. Meanwhile, worldwide sales of his back catalog topped the 100 million mark in 1999. Joel closed out the century with a gala Millennium Eve concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden.”\nInductee: Billy Joel (piano, vocals; born May 9, 1949)"}
{"text": "What is in this article?:\n- Ag of the future: Tech changing genetic potential of crops\n- Challenging tech\n- The rhizosphere\n- Pushing the plant\n- Traditional chemistry, bio result?\nCompanies are turning to biological approaches for boosting crop yields. The range of approaches is varied, from seed treatments to new sprays. Alliances bring more horsepower to product development efforts.\nTraditional chemistry, bio result?\nThe move toward research in biological products for a range of uses — from plant yield enhancement to pest control to disease prevention — is already showing benefits in the market. Yet there is “traditional chemistry” on the market that works on the plant, or the rhizosphere, as well. The key is that science is turning in the direction of tools that help the plant in addition to molecules that kill weeds or insect pests.\nThis change in direction is necessitated by the lack of new modes of action in traditional chemistry, and the potential available for biological approaches given the wide range of spores, bacteria and other beneficial organisms out there.\nHowever, there are traditional chemistry systems that work on the plant as well, creating ways to beat disease while having a low impact on the environment. Several years ago, Syngenta launched Actigard, a product that pushes the plant’s own resistance into high gear to battle certain diseases.\nAll plants have some form of protection, and Actigard, when applied, simply turns on that protection. The process is called systemic acquired resistance, or SAR, and it is an area of continued research as part of the move to work on ways to help the plant protect built-in yield potential.\nDifferentiating between the SAR from Actigard and the induced systemic resistance from a product like Regalia Rx gets into the biochemistry of the plant itself. This will be a growing area of interest as scientists get better at understanding plant processes.\nAt Stoller USA, the traditional chemistry the company uses has been shown to ignite specific plant genes, helping boost yields. “The plant experiences a lot of stresses,” says Jeff Morgan, Stoller USA. “We’re able to produce a genetic response that tells the plant to continue its normal processes, to do this, or do that, in season.”\nMorgan is talking about Bio-Forge, a popular product among yield contest winners year in and year out. The product is sprayed on — usually once per season, but the flexibility allows for low-rate multiple application — and helps offset plant stress and reduce yield loss. “Our data show that we’re telling the plant to signal a reduction in ethylene,” he says.\nEthylene is the gas produced when a stressed plant starts to senesce, or die off. Bio-Forge is another example of a product that works on the plant, not the pest, to boost yield and enhance performance.\nLike what you’re reading?

{"text": "Commercial coffee machines can be a huge asset to your business, whether you own a coffee shop or cafe, run a hotel or restaurant, or manage a large office. However, without the proper coffee machine servicing and attention, your coffee machine can:\n- Become expensive to run\n- Produce poor quality coffee\n- Become difficult to use over time.\nBy maintaining regular coffee machine servicing, you can always feel content about the coffee you’re serving to customers, employees and even those important office visitors that may stroll in for a big meeting.\nSo, with this in mind, here are five reasons why you should prioritise coffee machine repairs:\n1. To Limit Mould and Bacteria Growth\nRegularly servicing your commercial coffee machine is necessary for general health and safety standards. Without a maintenance schedule, your machine is more prone to mould and bacteria growth. Mould exposure can cause sickness, so it’s important to protect customers and employees that are consuming your coffee.\n2. For Better Tasting Coffee\nCoffee machine servicing is essential if you want to get the best out of your coffee blend. Diffusers and other pieces of equipment in your coffee machine are prone to accumulating old, burnt coffee grounds, which can ultimately make coffee taste bitter or metallic. Cleaning your machine gets rid of the buildup that could be keeping your coffee from tasting as delicious and fresh as possible.\n3. To Get a Return on Your Investment\nCommercial coffee machines are not a small investment. When you’re spending upwards of thousands of dollars on equipment, you need to maintain it regularly. Coffee machines for cafes and restaurants alike need routine maintenance if you want them to last longer and keep producing coffee that brings in revenue.\n4. For a Reputable Presentation\nNeglecting to take care of your coffee machine can leave a bad impression on customers of your business. Whether they’re constantly turned down coffee because of a broken machine or they can taste old bitter grounds, your customers or employees will notice. Wrestling with a coffee machine shouldn’t be a part of your day-to-day routine, and servicing will help get it back up to scratch.\n5. To Ensure Your Machine Runs As It Should\nCaring for your commercial coffee machine can improve its life span, which is a very important aspect when you consider how expensive machines are. Commercial coffee machines are designed to last between 10 and 15 years, so it’s important you do what you need to ensure this life span actually comes to fruition.\nCoffee Machine Servicing With Complete Coffee\nAt Complete Coffee, we know how important it is to keep your coffee machines clean and running. A broken-down, unkempt machine can keep you from achieving your goals and running a successful business.\nWe offer 24/7 breakdown service and direct contact with an account representative. Our coffee machine repairs process makes it simple and seamless for you to serve the coffee your business (and you) deserve.\nFor more information on our coffee machine servicing, contact us directly today."}

{"text": "Choosing a Wheelchair:\nThoughts from a physical therapist after attending the 2008 International Seating Symposium\nBy Debra Glazer, PT, MPH\nWhen I first became a physical therapist 15 years ago, there were very few seating and mobility products to choose from. Things have changed tremendously since then, and this was never more apparent to me than when I walked into the massive convention halls at the International Seating Symposium (ISS) in Vancouver, BC last March. Hundreds of vendors, from large manufacturers to small start-ups, filled three rooms that were each the size of a football field. Thanks to new materials and engineering advances, the choices now are plentiful, and also somewhat overwhelming.\nThe new consumer\nThere also has been a parallel shift in the consumer’s role in choosing a wheelchair. In the past, the clinician made the choice based on the patient’s injury level: C6-C7 and above would get a power wheelchair; T1 or below would get a manual one. Consumers were not consulted in these medical decisions. Today they are active participants in deciding what wheelchair is best for their body and lifestyle; some even invent new products to meet their specific needs.\nMore wheelchair users today are choosing to “blend” features from both manual and power technologies to develop a chair that enables them to conserve energy, avoid overuse of joints and fit their lifestyle. Some people with low-level tetraplegia choose manual wheelchairs to fit their office environments but make sure they get assistance with transfers at home to protect their shoulders. College students with paraplegia sometimes choose to use power wheelchairs to get around campus and switch to manual chairs for the tighter spaces of the dorm.\nShoulder and wrist pain\nAccording to Kendra Betz, MSPT, ATP, a conference speaker and nationally recognized wheelchair seating expert, there is ample research evidence showing that people who use manual wheelchairs are at risk for shoulder and elbow pathology and repetitive strain injury of the wrist and hand. The reason for these problems, however, is still being debated. Are they due to improper push technique or to wheelchairs that are incorrectly configured to the client’s anatomy? Are therapists too often recommending standard lightweight wheelchairs when ultra-light models might be a better choice? Which does more damage over time, pushing or transferring? Why do only some people get shoulder problems?\nMost clinicians would agree that the way an individual propels a wheelchair in clinic is probably very different from the way he or she pushes uphill on a city sidewalk. If a person’s lifestyle regularly leads to poor wheelchair technique, a power wheelchair or hybrid device might be a better choice, such as a power-assist or electric manual wheelchair with a small, removable motor. Hybrids are lighter, less expensive and much easier to transport than traditional power wheelchairs. On the other hand, they are heavier than standard manual chairs and harder to push when using manual mode. Another option is the two-gear manual wheel, which allows the user to shift to a lower gear to help with hills.\nIn the end, choosing a wheelchair is usually a trade-off. To make the best choice possible, clinicians and consumers will need to carefully consider all of these factors:\n- Self-image and lifestyle\n- What is the client’s attitude about power wheelchairs? Some people don’t like the way they look, thinking it will make them look “too disabled.” Younger people especially may be concerned about self-image issues.\n- What about activity level? Does the user love exercise or prefer to do as little activity as possible?\nWill fatigue from using a manual chair all day affect energy, productivity or enjoyment?\n- SCI severity\n- Is the injury complete or incomplete? This will make a big difference in functional ability.\n- Is this a new or long-standing injury? The first chair is often a “starter” chair because people continue to get return and gain strength during their first year after injury.\n- Medical Problems\nAre there medical problems that increase the need for a power wheelchair because of weakness, fatigue or skin concerns? Examples:\n- Diabetes decreases circulation and increases the risk for skin breakdown. If a person is too tired from pushing a manual wheelchair all day to perform adequate pressure relief, a power chair with a tilting system might be the safer choice.\n- Obesity: Although pushing a manual chair takes more energy than using a power chair, it does not provide sufficient cardiovascular exercise to contribute to weight loss or justify getting a manual chair. For this reason, someone with paraplegia who has good arm strength but is obese may be better off with a power chair to protect the shoulders.\n- Transfers status\n- Independence: How will wheelchair choice affect a person’s ability to perform transfers independently?\n- Safety: A manual wheelchair may enable the user to perform safer transfers with better technique than a power chair because it is more compact and easier to maneuver into a good transferring position.\n- Accessibility in multiple environments\n- Can the wheelchair user self-propel up a ramp into the home? Is the terrain around the home paved, gravel, level, uneven?\n- Could a power wheelchair fit into the home environment? How wide are the doorframes? Are there tight corners to negotiate? What turning radius does the wheelchair need to have? How large is the bathroom?\n- What about the workplace or school environment? A power chair is easier in large open spaces but more difficult for tight corners around cubicles.\n- Transportation from home to school or work.\n- Does the wheelchair need to fit in the trunk of a car, behind a seat, or in a van with a lift? It is very difficult to disassemble a power wheelchair to fit in a regular car trunk.\n- Does the user ride public transportation or a school bus?\n- Funding Source\n- Does the consumer’s funding source ever consider dual justification for both a manual and a power wheelchair?\n- What is the equipment allotment under the individual’s insurance coverage? Is this an annual allotment? It is very important to make an educated equipment decision. If the wrong equipment is purchased, the funding source usually will not pay for more equipment for another five years or unless the consumer’s medical condition changes dramatically.\n- If insurance will pay for only one chair, consider getting the more expensive power chair first, and then look for other kinds of funding—non-profits, sports organizations or grant options—to help buy a manual chair.\n- Hobbies and activities\n- What activities will the wheelchair user be involved with, such as indoor sports on a smooth floor vs. outdoor uneven terrain activities?\nI did not find a “right” answer to the manual-versus-power debate, but I did learn about many new options in wheelchair technology that I can pass on to my patients.\nMeanwhile, the most important take-home message hasn’t changed: thinking through everything ahead of time, before buying a wheelchair, will help you make the best choice for your physical and lifestyle needs.\n- Preservation of Upper Limb Function Following Spinal Cord Injury: A Clinical Practice Guideline for Health-Care Professionals.

{"text": "Coffin family house, Newburyport, MA, housed 240 Coffins since 1654.\nThe Tristram Coffyn family were among the first famlies of Newburyport, MA. Tristram and his pregnant wife, Dionis Stevens, and four children (Peter, Elizabeth, Tristram, and James), and his widowed mother, Joanna (her husband Peter having died 1628 at age 48), and his two unmarried sisters, Mary and Eunice, sailed on a 60 – 90 day journey on the “Hector Clement” and arrived in Newburyport in 1642. Their fifth child, John, apparently was born aboard the ship. Four other children (Deborah, Mary, John-2, Stephen) would be born in the New World, John, Mary, and Stephen dying in their infancy. The Coffyns were Royalists and may have come to America to avoid parlimentary rule under Cromwell.\nTristram soon moved his family to what is now Haverill, MA, having negotiated with the Indians for some land. He was the first white settler to plough land with a plough he made with his own hands. Times were difficult their with the Indians. After a few years of farming, and enduring much hardship, Tristram moved his family back to Newburyport where he opperated a ferry, kept Coffyn’s Ordinary (tavern/inn) which was run mostly by Dionis. In the 1650’s, after the ferry crossing was replaced by a floating bridge, Tristram sold his property and moved to Salisbury and became Commissioner there. In the late 1650’s Tristram Coffyn and a few others met with a Thomas Mayhew, the owner of Nantucket Island, which was independent of the Mass Bay Colony, and made arrangements to purchase the island and continue their adventure there. The island was purchased for 30 pounds and 2 beaver hats that were made by Tristram, Jr. Among the eight original owners of Nantucket Island were Tristram Coffyn, Peter Coffin, and Steven Greenleaf (husband of his daughter Elizabeth). Tristram was granted first choice for his lot of land. James and Tristram Coffin, Jr. also became land partners.Tristram Coffin, Jr. married Judith Greenleaf (widow of Henry Somersby with whom she had 4 children) and had 10 children. Tristram’s sister, Elizabeth married Steven Greenleaf and had 10 children. Our line of decent can be traced to Phebe Adams who’s mother, Sarah Dole, was related to Elizabeth and who’s father, Henry Adams, was related to Tristram Coffin. Joanna Coffyn died in 1661 and was remembered as being a remarkable woman.\nThe Coffin’s have an interesting history which you can learn more about at the following links:"}

{"text": "The United States is the only democratic country in the world where a candidate can be elected as president without earning the highest number of votes.\nIn the midst of competing campaigns and critical choices leading up to Election Day, one of the most common assumptions is that U.S. citizens directly select their president. However, far too many fail to fully understand that such direct selection is not our reality, for within our complex electoral system – known as the Electoral College – the will of the people does not always translate into final results. During the presidential elections of 1876, 1888, and 2000, the leader in popular votes did not claim victory, and some believe a similar scenario may take place in the near future. And so, when a candidate receives the majority of votes but is not sworn into office, we recognize a gross injustice that requires immediate and significant transformation.\nIn our current Election Day arrangement, citizens vote for a slate of electors – usually party leaders or officials – when they cast ballots for president. The total number of electors is 538, which is based upon the total voting membership of the U.S. Congress (435 Representatives and 100 Senators) and additional electors for the District of Colombia. The electors typically gather in their states about six weeks after the general election in order to cast ballots. Within the existing format, those from California (55), Texas (38), Florida (29), and New York (29) hold the most votes, whereas electors from Alaska, Delaware, the District of Colombia, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming all tie for the least (3).\nAmong other things, the founders of our nation viewed the system as a way to protect the interests of smaller states, and they figured the electors would be educated and connected citizens with enhanced insights to select national leaders. At the time of its creation the Electoral College was viewed as necessary due to poor communication across state boundaries, general lack of literacy, and a nationwide scarcity of voter information. But not only is the electoral system thoroughly out of date, but it is also counter to foundational democratic values and basic theological affirmations.\nWhile contemporary proponents of the Electoral College argue for its importance as a distinguishing feature of federalism in the United States, others righty reveal its flawed nature within our larger democratic pledge for equality. In other words, when a popular vote does not directly determine the outcome on an election, the striking consequence is that each vote is not equal, thus each individual voter is also not equal. And so, because of the irrelevance of our national popular vote, there is a disproportionate focus on the so-called swing states (Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin), which in turn provides an unbalanced amount of attention (and unjust level of power) in the hands of a minority at the expense of the majority.\nThose of marginal political persuasions that are significantly outnumbered in their state of residence – such as non-Republicans in Texas or non-Democrats in New York – often refuse to participate due to the perception of a meaningless vote. So the Electoral College is not only far past its historical usefulness, but it is also deeply disingenuous due to the disconnection between our values and current general election process.\nIn addition to the political shortcomings of our Electoral College, it can also be viewed as theologically damaged, as people of faith should be troubled to participate within a system that offers disproportionate levels of power and fails to represent the collective will of a popular electorate. As stated within various affirmations of faith, human beings are created in the image and likeness of God, which in turn leads to a basic level of dignity that transcends various labels, classifications, and distinctions. While much attention has been given to voter equality within various gender and racial demographics, we have yet to reform an Electoral College that continues to discriminate and disenfranchise various citizens every four years. And so, not only is our current electoral process contrary to democratic values, but it is also counter to basic theological affirmations, thus it should be reformed as a response to God’s grace and public expression of personal faith.\nIn a country that repeatedly states the importance of democratic equality, and in light of our theological affirmations of human dignity and sacred value, the Electoral College is not acceptable and thus requires immediate and dramatic transformation. While some can provide numerous reasons for keeping the system as it is, and one recognizes the various logistical steps and financial costs needed for such reforms, as responsible citizens we cannot continue within a configuration that is contrary to the values of our democracy, and as people of faith we should not support a structure that is counter to our core theological convictions. And so, while attempts to reform the Electoral College have appeared frequently in past years, the time is upon us for a more serious and sustained effort, regardless of the results on our upcoming Election Day. Basically, it is time for the Electoral College to graduate.\nWithin our democracy, a voter in Alabama should have the same influence as one in New Mexico, and those who visit the polls in Wisconsin should have the same power as those who do the same in California, Texas, or New York. As the president of the United States should be elected by the people and for the people, and because our current system does not guarantee such results, the time is upon us to ensure that the Electoral College is reformed or removed before further damage is done. As those who believe in the equal access of political participation, and as people of faith that affirm the sacred value of all human beings, we should demand a fair and balanced electoral system, and we should not settle for anything less.\nBrian E.

{"text": "Major League Baseball Teams: A Short History\nBaseball is America’s Favorite Pastime. Whether or not you agree with that statement, the business that is Major League Baseball is definitely woven into America’s long and diverse historical tapestry. The teams of today’s Major Leagues have come a long way from those of yesteryear; some are original but many are not. Baseball has changed over the years but the sport continues to draw large crowds to the ballpark, season after season.\nThen to Now\nFor recreational purposes, participants played various-ruled \"baseball\" games in earlier years. It was 1869 when the first professional team came together in Cincinnati; other teams would soon follow. In 1876, “organized baseball” created what was known then (and still now) as the National League (NL); the American League (AL) came into existence in 1901.\nBeginning in 1903 and for many decades to follow, NL and AL teams played against each other in All-Star and postseason playoff games. The two leagues, however, were completely separate legal organizations until the year 2000 when they “officially” merged into a single entity. Today, there are 30 teams (29 in the United States; one in Canada) that play 162 games each season. The playoffs allow deserving teams to advance to \"the postseason\" for each league’s pennant (championship series) and then a shot at the World Series.\nFrom 1903 to 1953, the National and American leagues each had eight teams (located in the Midwestern and Northeastern areas of the United States).\nIn 1962, the National League consisted of: Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Colt .45s, Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Braves, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. The Houston team would be re-named the Astros in 1965.\nIn 1962, the American League consisted of: Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, Los Angeles Angels, Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees and Washington Senators. The Los Angeles team would be called the California Angels in 1965.\nIn 1968, Major League Baseball held an expansion draft, adding these teams for the start of the 1969 season: Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres and Seattle Pilots.\nIn 1977, the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays joined Major League Baseball.\nIn 1993, two more teams became part of the National League; the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies.\nIn 1998, another two expansion teams came along; the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known as the Tampa Bay Rays) and the Arizona Diamondbacks).\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the National and American leagues each had two divisions: East and West. In 1994 they split into three-way (East, Central and West) divisions. Throughout the tenure of Major League Baseball and until the end of the 1996 season, National and American league teams only played each other during All-Star games and the World Series.\nThe “experiment” of seasonal Interleague play came about in 1997 -- the idea was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 teams divided into three divisions). However, among the planning issues in general, there were uncertainties about whether the players’ union would approve changes in game scheduling. For the 1998 season, Major League Baseball decided to continue with an even number of teams in each league. One club (the Milwaukee Brewers) moved from the AL to the National League; allowing the NL to have 16 teams (and the America League to have 14 teams). It was in 2013 when the Houston Astros jumped from the NL to the American League’s Western Division -- both leagues now have three divisions of five teams each. In the beginning, Interleague play was limited to a select number of weeks but now it is scheduled throughout the season.\nThe National League; Today and Yesterday\nOf all the teams that are Major League Baseball, only a few of these clubs actually started with their current franchise names. Teams are listed in alphabetical order:\nArizona Diamondbacks (1998; Western Division): This franchise was awarded in 1995 -- the Diamondbacks are the original team name. With retired numbers, players of note are pitcher Randy Johnson (51) and outfielder Louis Gonzalez (20).\nAtlanta Braves (1871; Western Division): Established in Boston, Massachusetts, the original team played in that city from 1871 through the 1952 season. In 1953, the Braves moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- playing baseball there until the end of the 1965 campaign. The Atlanta Braves took the field in 1966.* Famous Braves with retired numbers include slugger/outfielder Hank Aaron (44); infielders Eddie Matthews (41) and Chipper Jones (10); pitchers Phil Niekro (35), Greg Maddux (31), John Smoltz (29), Tom Glavine (47) and Warren Spahn (21); outfielder Dale Murphy (3) and manager Bobby Cox (6).\n*Atlanta Braves History continued … Many historians consider the Braves franchise to be the oldest in organized baseball. (Although the Chicago Cubs began at the same time, that team lost a couple of seasons following 1871’s Great Chicago Fire). From its inception in 1871, the Braves (originally founded as the Boston Red Stockings) have had several name changes.\n- Boston Braves (1871-1875)\n- Boston Red Caps (1876-1882)\n- Boston Bean Eaters (1883-1906)\n- Boston Doves (1907-1910)\n- Boston Rustlers (1911)\n- Boston Braves (1912-1935)\n- Boston Bees (1936-1940)\n- Boston Braves (1941-1952)\n- Milwaukee Braves (1954-1965)\n- Atlanta Braves (1966 to present)\nChicago Cubs (1874; Central Division): The original franchise began in Chicago as the Chicago White Stockings of the National Association; the team became part of the National League in 1876 and kept the name until 1889. From 1890 through 1897, the team was called the Chicago Colts. In 1898, the team transitioned into the Chicago Orphans but since 1903, the Chicago Cubs have been -- and still are -- a solid staple of the Windy City. Famous Chicago Cubs players (with retired numbers) include infielders Ernie Banks (14), Ryne Sandberg (23) and Ron Santo (10); pitcher Ferguson Jenkins (31) and outfielder Billy Williams (26).\nCincinnati Reds (1882; Central Division): The team started out in the American Association (AA) as the Cincinnati Red Stockings from 1882 to 1889; joining the National League in 1890. The “Red Stockings” were known as the Reds from 1890 to 1953, and then, in 1954, the team’s name lengthened to the Redlegs (until the end of the 1959 season). The Queen City of Cincinnati once again called its baseball team the Reds, beginning in 1960.\nThere are more than several prominent Cincinnati Reds players (with retired numbers), including: catcher Johnny Bench (5); infielders Joe Morgan (8), Tony Perez (24), Barry Larkin (11) and Dave Concepcion (13); managers Fred Hutchinson (1) and Sparky Anderson (10); outfielder Frank Robinson (20) and coach Ted Kluszewski (18). Infielder/outfielder manager Pete Rose, although still “officially” banned from baseball, was inducted to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in June of 2016.\nColorado Rockies (1993; Western Division): Founded in 1991, the expansion club Rockies began their Major League Baseball franchise in 1993. Although (as of this writing) no players have had numbers retired, the team won the National League pennant in 2007. Several Colorado Rockies have been honored by Major League Baseball for Most Valuable Player (MVP), National League Rookie of the Year, Silver Slugger and Golden Glove achievements.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (1884; Western Division): The Dodgers began their long franchise history in Brooklyn, New York. The team actually came together in 1883 as the Brooklyn Grays of the minor leagues' Interstate Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. The Grays joined the American Association in 1884 under its new name -- the Brooklyn Atlantics -- which lasted only that first season. Over the next few years, the American Association team changed names twice: Brooklyn Grays (1885-1887) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1888-1890).\nAfter joining Major League Baseball's National League in 1890, the team operated as the Brooklyn Grooms (1891-1895); Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1896-1898); Brooklyn Superbas (1899-1910); Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers (1911-1912); Brooklyn Superbas (1913) and Brooklyn Robins (1914-1931). In 1932 (until 1957), the Brooklyn Dodgers came to life. This team occupied four locations during their long franchise history in Brooklyn, New York: Washington Park I (1884-1990); Ridgewood Park (Sunday games only, 1886-1889); Eastern Park (1891-1897); Washington Park II (1898-1912); and Ebbets Field (1913-1957).\nThere were many famous Dodgers but the retired team numbers are for infielders Pee Wee Reese (1), Jim Gilliam (19) and Jackie Robinson (42); outfielder Duke Snider (4); pitchers Don Sutton (20), Sandy Koufax (32) and Don Drysdale (53); catcher Roy Campanella (39); managers Tommy Lasorda (2) and Walter Alston (24). Other notable members of the Dodgers’ organization include Leo Durocher, Burleigh Grimes, Rabbit Maranville, Willie Keeler, Dazzy Vance, Maury Wills and Juan Marichal.\n*Los Angeles Dodgers History continued … At the end of the 1957 season, majority team owner Walter O’Malley announced that the Brooklyn Dodgers would be moving west to Los Angeles in California. Originally, after O’Malley bought team shares from co-owners Branch Rickey and James L. Smith, the plan was to purchase land in Brooklyn to build a new stadium. The infrastructure at Ebbets Field was getting old and, despite the sentiment Dodgers fans held for that ballpark, attendance figures were low. When New York City officials would not agree to provide O’Malley the eminent domain authority needed to build a new stadium, the Dodgers’ majority owner decided to look at moving the team to California -- travel there would now be by airplanes (instead of trains). Los Angeles officials put the word out that they wanted to have a Major League Baseball team established in that city and so when O’Malley heard this, he told them he would consider moving the Dodgers to LA.\nThe city of Los Angeles then offered Brooklyn Dodgers majority owner Walter O’Malley a deal that the businessman felt he could not refuse: the ability to purchase as much land as necessary for building a stadium -- and actually owning that stadium outright (which allowed him to control all sources of revenue). New York officials countered with an offer to build a stadium in Queens that would be shared by both the Dodgers and the New York Giants -- O'Malley refused. (It wouldn’t be long after that when the New York Giants made their way to San Francisco, CA). The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game on September 24, 1957 at Ebbets Field. They beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-0.\nMiami Marlins (1993; Eastern Division): This expansion team began as the Florida Marlins, from 1993 until 2011. In 2012, with a new ballpark built in downtown Miami, the Florida Marlins officially changed their name to the Miami Marlins -- complete with a different logo and branding colors. The Florida Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and 2003. As of this writing, there are no retired Florida/Miami player numbers.\nMilwaukee Brewers (1969; Central Division): The Milwaukee Brewers* were, in the beginning, a team located in Seattle called the Seattle Pilots.** After lasting only one season as the Pilots, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin with a new name -- the Brewers (in recognition of that area’s beer and brewing industry) -- to be part of the American League. From 1970 through the end of the 1997 season, the Milwaukee Brewers played baseball in the American League. However, in 1998, with the start of Interleague competitions (and in order to even out the number of teams in each league), the Brewers moved to the National League.\nRetired Milwaukee Brewers numbers include: team owner Bud Selig (1); infielders Paul Molitor (4) and Robin Yount (19); pitcher Rollie Fingers (34) and outfielder/Designated Hitter Hank Aaron (44).\n*Milwaukee Brewers History continued … The original Milwaukee Brewers were a minor league team; part of the Western League of the American Association. At the start of the year 1900 season, the Western League was renamed American League; the AL then joined Major League Baseball in 1901. American League founder and President Byron Bancroft (“Ban”) Johnson wanted to move the Milwaukee Brewers to St. Louis but because he was not able to find a suitable owner, the team played baseball in Milwaukee for the 1901 season. In 1902, the American Association/Western League/American League Milwaukee Brewers did move to St. Louis to become the St. Louis Browns. The Browns remained intact through the 1953 season. The team then moved to Baltimore to become the Orioles.\n** Milwaukee Brewers History continued … In 1969, the Seattle Pilots expansion team joined the American League's Western Division. The Pilots were actually slated to play their inaugural season in 1971 -- the same year as another expansion team; the Kansas City Royals. However, a Missouri state senator convinced Major League Baseball to move forward sooner because Kansas City lost the Athletics (to Oakland) after the 1967 season.\nBecause it was necessary to have an even number of teams in each division, both the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots began playing in 1969. The Pilots had a poorly-performing team, low attendance, financial problems and other issues which originally included the lack of accessibility to an acceptable stadium facility. Failed attempts to improve upon the ballclub's numerous challenges or sell the team outright led to a bankruptcy filing -- the Pilots’ franchise was officially declared bankrupt six days before Opening Day in 1970. A minority owner of the Milwaukee Braves, Bug Selig, bought the Pilots and moved the team to Milwaukee. He renamed it the “Brewers” (after what was the minor leagues’ American Association (AA) Milwaukee Brewers ballclub. As previously noted, that AA team became the Major League's St. Louis Browns of 1902-1953). Selig’s team was first known as the “new” Milwaukee Brewers.\nNew York Mets (1962; Eastern Division): The New York Mets play baseball in the Queens borough of the city, in Flushing. Major League Baseball awarded a franchise to the Mets in the early 1960s because the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants both left the New York area at the end of the 1957 season. The Mets have these numbers retired: manager Casey Stengel (37); infielder Gil Hodges (14); pitcher Tom Seaver (41) and catcher Mike Piazza (31). Other notable Mets players include catcher Gary Carter, pitcher John Franco and infielder David Wright.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (1883; Eastern Division): From the team’s beginning in 1883, the Philadelphia Phillies have been the National League’s Philadelphia Phillies; it is the oldest one-city, one-name franchise in baseball (and all professional sports). But the club history goes back to Massachusetts, 1879. The original team, called the Worcester Ruby Legs (also known as the Brown Stockings or Worcester Worcesters), played in the minor league's National Association. This minor league team became affiliated with MLB's National League from 1880 to 1882 but it was in 1883 when Major League Baseball, needing to balance the playing schedule, awarded a franchise to the Philadelphia Phillies.*\nNo original players (from the Massachusetts team) came to the new franchise in Philadelphia. The first Philadelphia Phillies game was played at home on May 1, 1883 (Recreation Park -- the team lost to the Providence Grays). The Philadelphia Phillies gave life to the careers of many of its alumni with retired numbers for: outfielder Richie Ashburn (1); pitchers Jim Bunning (14), Steve Carlton (32) and Robin Roberts (36); and infielder Mike Schmidt (20). Honored insignias are “P” in different fonts for right-handed pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander (who pitched for the Phillies from 1911-1917 and in 1930), and outfielder Chuck Klein (three stints with the Phillies: 1928-1933, 1936-1939 and 1940-1944).\n*Philadelphia Phillies History continued … In 1883, the team was founded as the Quakers but quickly took on the name Philadelphias -- subsequently shortened to Phillies. The ballclub held on to both names (Phillies and Quakers) from 1883 to 1890.\nPittsburgh Pirates (1882; Central Division): Professional baseball began in Pittsburgh in 1876 when independent player organizations (known as “barnstormers”) traveled the country looking for competitive, financially lucrative games with local teams. In the fall of 1881, one of these solid barnstorming troupes joined the American Association -- and then slated as \"professional\" in the spring of 1882. Because the team's home playing field was in Allegheny City (across from the Allegheny River), the group was sometimes called the Alleghenys (spelled just that way).\nIn 1887, the Alleghenys left the American Association to join the National League, first calling themselves the Pittsburgh Alleghenys * (until 1890). The club became the Pittsburgh/Pittsburg Pirates ** in 1891. Of the many famous names in Pittsburgh Pirates history, these numbers are retired: manager Billy Meyer (1); infielders Bill Mazeroski (9), Pie Traynor (20) and Honus Wagner (33); outfielders Ralph Kiner (4), Willie Stargell (8), Paul Waner (11), Roberto Clemente (21) and Danny Murtaugh (40).\n* Pittsburgh Pirates History continued … Historical accounts have the name “Pirates” coming about this way: Before the 1890 season, many Alleghenys players left that team for \"greener pastures\" -- the league allowed members to return to former ballclubs. But the Alleghenys obtained a well-sought infielder who had previously played with the American Association’s Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics neglected to include second baseman Lou Bierbauer on their reserve list (which would have kept other teams from being able to acquire his services), the A’s protested against the Alleghenys; calling the move “piratical.” The Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing but the name stuck. Pittsburg (without the “h” **) took the name Pirates in 1891 through 1911. The team officially became the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1912.\n**Pittsburgh Pirates History continued … The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) -- a Federal organization created in 1890 to maintain uniformed standards of geographic names in the U.S. -- forced the city of Pittsburgh to drop the “h” at the end of its name. The purpose of the BGN was to resolve name inconsistencies and new-name proposals for public entities and private organizations.\nIn 1891, the BGN created general principles to standardize names that ended in “burgh,” so that the final “h” should be removed, thus, Pittsburgh became Pittsburg. (Printed copies of the city’s 1816 charter called the area Pittsburg, but the original charter included the “h,” making it Pittsburgh. Still, newspapers and businesses were varied as to whether or not they used the “h”). Upon controversy and public resistance to Pittsburg, the United States Geographic Board (a successor organization to the BGN) officially changed the name to Pittsburgh in July of 1911.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1882; Central Division): The professional baseball team that eventually became the Cardinals began play in 1875, as the St. Louis Brown Stockings of the National Association. The demise of the National Association occurred within the 1875 season; the Brown stockings joined Major League Baseball’s National League in 1876. But in 1877, the ballclub got caught up in a game-fixing scandal and eventually went bankrupt (the National League also expelled the team).\nThe players stayed together in the organization, going on professional barnstorming tours through 1881. In 1882, businessman and entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased the Brown Stockings and reorganized the team to become the first member of the newly-created American Association. The team shortened its name to the St. Louis Browns.*\nAfter the 1891 season, the American Association went bankrupt; the St. Louis Browns were welcomed back to the National League. In 1899, the St. Louis team, in its 18th season, was called the Perfectos; re-named by two brothers who had purchased the franchise (Frank Robison and Stanley Robison) from previous owner Chris von der Ahe. The Perfectos’ uniform had “cardinal red trim and sock striping,” and, as noted by an area sportswriter, fans liked the Perfectos’ nickname “Cardinals.” Cardinals later became the official name for the team’s players.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals’ list of retired numbers is a long one: infielders Ozzie Smith (1), Red Schoendienst (2), Stan Musial (6), Ken Boyer (14) and Rogers Hornsby (with the “SL” logo); pitchers Jay Hanna “Dizzy” Dean (17), Bruce Sutter (42) and Bob Gibson (45); outfielders Enos Slaughter (9) and Lou Brock (20); managers Tony La Russa (10) and Whitey Herzog (24). Number 85 is retired for long time team owner Gussie Busch (who died in 1989).\n*St. Louis Cardinals History continued … In 1902, because there was no longer a team called the St. Louis Browns, a team from Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the original minor league team Milwaukee Brewers) moved into St. Louis and called themselves the St. Louis Browns. The newly-christened St. Louis Browns played through the 1953 season. (See *Milwaukee Brewers History).\nSan Diego Padres (1969; Western Division): Beginning with the 1969 season, Major League Baseball added four expansion teams; the San Diego Padres, Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos and Seattle Pilots. The team name “Padres” came from a minor league franchise of the Pacific Coast League (1936). “Padres” -- the Spanish word for “fathers\" -- refers to the Franciscan Friars who founded the city of San Diego in 1769.\nPadres’ players whose numbers are retired: infielder Steve Garvey (6); outfielders Tony Gwynn (19) and Dave Winfield (31); pitchers Randy Jones (35) and Trevor Hoffman (51). Other San Diego Padres players of note include infielders Nate Colbert and Gary Templeton, and catcher Benito Santiago.\nSan Francisco Giants (1883; Western Division): The San Francisco Giants began their long history in New York City -- the team was originally called the Gothams. The Gothams officially became the New York Giants in 1886. The Gothams, having entered the National League in 1883, was the sister ballclub of another organization, the Metropolitans (of the American Association. The 19th century New York Metropolitans* played in the city from 1880 to 1887). There are several notable “eras” for the New York Giants:\n- 1902: John McGraw was signed on to be a player-manager. He managed the team until 1932 -- during that 30 year period, the Giants won nine National League pennants and three World Series championships. The Giants (with McGraw's coaching staff) won another pennant and World Series championship the year following his retirement.\n- From 1930 to 1957, the Giants won 5 pennants; the most notable came in 1951 with the “shot heard around the world” that occurred in the playoff game (against the Brooklyn Dodgers) when outfielder Bobby Thomson hit a “walk-off” game-winning (and pennant winning) home run. Another memorable moment for the Giants came in the first game of the 1954 World Series (against Cleveland). With the game tied at two runs each, outfielder Willie Mays made an over-the-shoulder catch that kept the Indians from scoring. (The Indians had two runners on with no one out). The Giants won that game with a tenth inning home run).\nThe New York Giants made the move to San Francisco at the end of 1957 season. The team was looking to build a new stadium in New York but Giants’ majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations with San Francisco’s mayor. It was around the same time as the Brooklyn Dodgers had announced their impending move to Los Angeles, California. From 1958 until 1962, there would be only one Major League Baseball team left in New York; the Yankees. The New York Mets joined the National League for the 1962 season.\nThe San Francisco Giants have retired their share of player numbers, including: outfielders Mel Ott (4), Monte Ervin (20) and Willie Mays (24); infielders Bill Terry (3), Orlando Cepeda (11) and Willie MCovey (44); pitchers Carl Hubbell (11), Gaylord Perry (36) and Juan Marichal (27). Pitcher Christy Mathewson and player/manager John McGraw are both been honored with special NY signature logos. Other great names in Giants history include (but are not limited to) Felipe Alou, Bobby Bonds, Jim Ray Hart, Chili Davis and Tito Fuentes.\n*San Francisco Giants History continued … From 1880-1887, the New York Metropolitans -- NOT to be confused with the current day New York Mets -- was a “sister team” to the New York Gothams. The Metropolitans (also called the Mets) won the 1884 American Association pennant but the team could not stay profitable. In early 1886, the Metropolitans were sold; the new ownership could not keep the team afloat, thus, the franchise dissolved at the end of the 1887 season. However, in 1887, territorial and player contracts were purchased by the Brooklyn Dodgers in order to keep them protected from other teams.\nWashington Nationals (1969; Eastern Division): Before moving to Washington D.C., the team -- called the Montreal Expos -- was located in Montreal, Quebec (Canada).* The Expos were part of 1969's National League expansion (along with California's San Diego Padres. The American League also added two teams). The Washington Nationals began their franchise history in 2005. Currently, there are no specific Washington Nationals numbers that are retired, however, those of the Montreal Expos include catcher Gary Carter (8); outfielders Rusty Staub and Andre Dawson (both had number 10), and Tim Raines (30).\n*Washington Nationals/Montreal Expos History continued … Professional baseball in Montreal began in the International Association (1890). In 1897, the Montreal Royals created a Canadian minor league franchise that, in 1939, became an affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers organization. After the Royals left, Montreal's mayor began lobbying Major League Baseball for a team -- it wasn’t until the spring of 1968 that the National League awarded expansion teams to Montreal and San Diego.\nIn 1994, following a player strike within all of Major League Baseball, the Expos were no longer able to afford or compete for high-priced talent. As a result, the team unloaded the contracts of some of their premium players (John Wetteland, Marquis Grissom and Ken Hill). Other players left the team for Free Agency (Pedro Martinez, Mel Rojas, Moises Alou and Larry Walker).\nFrom 1995 to around 2000, game attendance from (apparently angry) Montreal Expos fans dropped significantly -- the team lost a lot of games. In 2001, under a new general manager, the Expos planned to build a stadium and spend more money on payroll (provided by a cash infusion from team share holders). Although payroll for the 2000 season increased dramatically, the team’s losing record drove away fan interest. With the future of Olympic Stadium’s poor conditions still at issue, and several unproductive trades, fan support declined even further. The end of the Montreal Expos seemed to be just a matter of time.\nIn 2001, Major League Baseball began the transaction of eliminating two franchises -- the Montreal Expos and Minnesota Twins -- but legal challenges stopped the process. In Minnesota, MLB was forced to honor the Twins’ stadium lease. In the meantime, the Expos survived the revocation attempt because the league needed to keep an even number of teams for scheduling purposes. Shortly after, the Expos’ majority owner sold the team directly to Major League Baseball; the ultimate plan was to move the franchise out of Montreal. The Montreal Expos’ played their final season in 2004. Beginning in 2005, the franchise would become the Washington Nationals.\nOn April 15, 1997, Major League baseball retired number 42 for all teams, in honor of Brooklyn Dodgers infielder Jackie Robinson.\nAmerican League; Today and Yesterday\nSimilar to the National League, only a few of the American League teams still operate under the same name of their original franchise. Teams are listed in alphabetical order:\nBaltimore Orioles (1901; Eastern Division): Under a different name, the Orioles franchise was one of the first and original charters created for the American League in 1901. (At that time, they were called the Milwaukee Brewers). In 1902, the original minor league Brewers team was moved to St. Louis to become Major League Baseball's St. Louis Browns (through the end of the 1953 season; see Milwaukee Brewers history*). In 1954, the St. Louis Browns franchise moved to Baltimore to become the Orioles (an oriole is the official bird of the state of Maryland). Retired Baltimore Orioles numbers are: manager Earl Weaver (4); infielders Brooks Robinson (5), Cal Ripken Jr. (8) and Eddie Murray (33); outfielder-manager Frank Robinson (20) and pitcher Jim Palmer (22).\nBoston Red Sox (1901; Eastern Division): One of the original charter teams of the new American League in 1901, this Boston team began their franchise as the Americans -- keeping that name through the 1907 season. Boston changed its team name to the Red Sox (for their uniform’s red stocking hose); this moniker was similar to one used by the Chicago White Sox. Not to be confused with the Boston Red Stockings of the National League (a team that eventually became the Boston Braves), the Boston Americans/Red Sox originally wore uniforms with dark blue stockings. In those early years, the team was referred to as the Bostons, Americans, Bostonians, Boston Americans, and other nicknames coined by newspaper editors.\nRetired Boston Red Sox numbers include: infielders Bobby Doerr (1), Joe Cronin (4) and Johnny Pesky (6); outfielders Carl Yastrzemski (8), Ted Williams (9) and Jim Rice (14); pitcher Pedro Martinez (45) and catcher Carlton Fisk (27). From 1901 through 1911, the Boston Red Sox played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds (a stadium located across the tracks from the home of the Boston Braves). The Boston Red Sox began their long term residence at Fenway Park, beginning in 1912.\nChicago White Sox (1901; Central Division): Before beginning their long career as the \"pale-hosers\" of Chicago, the original Sioux City Cornhuskers were in the minor leagues. Famed owner Charles Comiskey bought the team in 1894, first moving the franchise to Minnesota (to become the St. Paul Saints). In 1900, the Saints moved into Chicago to become the White Stockings. (This name had originally been used by Chicago’s National League team). In 1901, as the American League came into existence, the Major League White Stockings became the White Sox.\nFamed Chicago White Sox players and coaches had their numbers retired, including: infielders Nellie Fox (2), Luke Appling (4), Louis Aparicio (11), Paul Konerko (14) and Frank Thomas (35); outfielders Harold Baines (3) and Minnie Minoso (9); catcher Carlton Fisk (72); pitchers Ted Lyons (16) and Billy Pierce (19).\nCleveland Indians (1901; Central Division): The Indians’ Major League franchise came about in 1901 (with the newly-established American League) but the team actually began professional play in Michigan as the minor league Grand Rapids Rustlers (1894-1899).* In 1900, the ballclub moved to Cleveland to become the Lake Shores and the Western League changed its name to the American League (although the organization still had minor league status at that time).\nIn 1901, when the American League joined the majors with eight franchise teams, the Cleveland Bluebirds began their play at League Park. The Major League Cleveland team changed names in 1902 to the Broncos. From 1903 to 1914, players were called the Naps -- after player-manager Napoléon \"Nap\" Lajoie. In 1915, the team adopted the name Indians in honor of Native American Louis Sockalexis (who played in Cleveland from 1897 to 1899).\nRetired Cleveland Indians’ numbers include: outfielders Earl Averill (3) and Larry Doby (14); shortstop-manager Lou Boudreau (5); pitchers Bob Feller (19), Mel Harder (18) and Bob Lemon (21). Hall of famers from the Cleveland Naps: Cy Young, Nap Lajoie, Addie Joss and Elmer Flick. Other famous Cleveland Indians of years past: Tris speaker, Early Wynn, Al Lopez, Stan Coveleski, Satchel Paige, Gaylord Perry, Frank Robinson and Joe Sewell.\n*Cleveland Indians History continued … Organized baseball began in Cleveland before the minor league/major league teams came into existence. In 1865 (at the end of the Civil War), young men played baseball under the name Cleveland Forest Citys. This amateur baseball club stood through 1868. In 1869 through 1870, Cleveland was awarded “professional” status -- still called the Forest Citys. In 1871, then with the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), the Forest Citys were caught in the turmoil created by the Great Chicago Fire of October, 1871. With the White Stockings not being able to play baseball in that city (and two other NA teams out of business), the league’s ability to continue was compromised. The Cleveland Forest Citys folded in 1872.\nSeveral years later, the city of Cleveland rebuilt the Forest Citys to play professional baseball (circa 1879). The National League took over the National Association -- because the NL wanted specific colors to be associated with teams, the Forest Citys became the Cleveland Blues in 1882. (The Cleveland Blues left for St. Louis in 1885). The city of Cleveland was without a professional baseball team until 1887; picking up a minor league team from the American Association. The new cub, called the Spiders and led by Ohioan Cy Young, began the franchise’s long tenure at League Park. The Spiders disbanded in 1899. It was 1900 when the Grand Rapids Rustlers of Michigan moved to Cleveland, became the Lake Shores and then the Bluebirds (joining the American League) in 1901. Thus began the history of Major League Baseball in Cleveland.\nDetroit Tigers (1901; Central Division): Since 1901, the Detroit Tigers have been called the Detroit Tigers; the team is an original charter member of the American League (along with the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox). The Tigers, now in the Central Division, played in the AL East from 1969 to 1997. The franchise has retired many player numbers, including: infielders Charlie Gehringer (2) and Hank Greenberg (5); outfielders Al Kaline (6) and Willie Horton (23); pitcher Hal Newhouser (16) and manager Sparky Anderson (11). Special honors are granted to outfielders Ty Cobb, Harry Heilmann, Heinie Manush and Sam Crawford; catcher Mickey Cochrane; infielder George Kell; manager Hughie Jennings and broadcaster Ernie Harwell.\nHouston Astros (1962; Western Division): Up until 2013, the Houston Astros were part of the National League. But professional baseball in Houston began in 1888 (through 1961) with the minor league Houston Buffaloes. In October of 1960, Major League Baseball awarded a National League expansion franchise to a group of businessmen representing the Houston Sports Association. Although the team could begin playing Major League Baseball the following season, issues concerning territorial rights prevented the Buffaloes franchise from continuing in the city of Houston. Thus, the minor league organization was sold and rechristened as the Houston Colt .45s (as a result of a “name the team” contest). The team, ready for action, became a National League member in 1962. Later, with a new domed stadium set to open, the Houston Colt .45s became the Houston Astros on December 1, 1964.\nIn 2013, the Houston Astros joined the American League; Major League Baseball was creating a realignment of all divisions so that each league would have 15 teams (and more of a “geographical balance”). Retired Houston Astros numbers are: infielders Jeff Bagwell (5) and Crag Biggio (7); outfielders Jimmy Wynn (24) and José Cruz (25); pitchers Jim Umbricht (32), Mike Scott (33), Nolan Ryan (34), Don Wilson (40) and Larry Dierker (49).\nKansas City Royals (1969; Central Division): The Royals began as an expansion team in the American League (along with the Seattle Pilots). The Royals were named for American Royal -- a livestock and horse show held in Kansas City each fall. The team, initially in the AL’s Western Division, brought baseball back to Kansas City after the Athletics moved to Oakland, California. Retired Kansas City Royals’ numbers are: manager Dick Howser (10); infielders George Brett (5) and Frank White (20).\nIn addition to the Athletics, from 1955 to 1967, Kansas City had a number of professional baseball teams:\n- Kansas City Blues (Minor League’s American Association; 1888-1954)\n- Kansas City Blues (Western League; 1894-1900)\n- Kansas City Cowboys (Union Association; 1884)\n- Kansas City Cowboys (Major League’s American Association; 1888-1889)\n- Kansas City Cowboys (Major League’s National League; 1886)\n- Kansas City Monarchs (Negro Leagues; 1920-1931)\n- Kansas City Packers (Federal League; 1914-1915)\n- Kansas City T-Bones (American Association of Independent Professional Baseball; 2003-present. This league is NOT affiliated with Major League Baseball).\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim (1961; Central Division): Beginning as an expansion team, the Angels have always been the Angels, but the named city has changed several times. From 1961 through 1965, they were the Los Angeles Angels. The team was known as the California Angels from 1966 to 1996; in 1997 -- the Anaheim Angels (until 2004). The ballclub became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005. The American League’s Los Angeles baseball team’s retired numbers are for: infielders Jim Fregosi (11) and Rod Carew (29); pitcher Nolan Ryan (30), coach Jimmie Reese (50) and team founder Gene Autry (26).\nMinnesota Twins (1901; Central Division): The eventual Minnesota Twins team actually started as the Washington Senators (also called the Washington Nationals) of Washington D.C.; one of the American League's original 1901 expansion franchises. In 1960, when the city of Minneapolis was granted its own expansion team, the owners of the Washington club wanted to move their ballclub to Minnesota (and thus allow the city of Washington to obtain the expansion team). The league said “yes” -- allowing the original Washington Senators to become the Minnesota Twins. The city of Washington D.C. developed a new team, also called the Washington Senators.\nThe Minnesota Twins, named for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (the Twin Cities) would actually have been called the Twin City Twins, if the franchise's majority owner had his way. He was concerned that fans would be put off if the team was based in either St. Paul or Minneapolis. Major League Baseball denied that request, but did allow the Minnesota Twins to keep the “TC” logo for its branding and caps.\nThe pre-Minnesota Twins/Washington Senators/Nationals groomed the career of pitching great Walter Johnson (1907). Retired numbers: outfielder/infielder Harmon Killebrew (11); outfielders Tony Oliva (6) and Kirby Puckett (34); infielders Kent Hrbek (14) and Rod Carew (29); pitcher Bert Blyleven (28) and manager Tom Kelly (10).\nNew York Yankees (1903; Eastern Division): The New York Yankees actually began their long franchise history in Baltimore, Maryland because the National League’s New York Giants blocked plans by Major League Baseball to add another team to the city of New York.\nThis Baltimore Orioles team played baseball from 1901 through the 1902 season. In 1903, following a “peace conference” between the National and American Leagues to settle disputes (including clubs “raiding” other teams for players), baseball team owners agreed to allow another franchise in New York City. Following the (original) Orioles’ move to Hilltop Park in northern Manhattan, the American League New York team then adopted a new name; the Highlanders (1903-1912). Because of another nickname (the Americans) that referred to the AL ballclub, a New York Press editor referred to the team in print as the Yankees or Yanks -- it was easier to fit on the headline page. The team became the New York Yankees, starting in 1913.\nThe New York Yankees claim many of baseball’s historical figures. The Yankees retired these numbers, in honor of: manager/infielder Billy Martin (1); outfielders Babe Ruth (3), Joe DiMaggio (5), Mickey Mantle (7), Roger Maris (9), Reggie Jackson (44) and Bernie Williams (51); infielders Lou Gehrig (4), Phil Rizzuto (10) and Don Mattingly (23); catchers Bill Dickey (8), Yogi Berra (8), Thurman Munson (15), Jorge Posada (20) and Elston Howard (32); pitchers Whitey Ford (16), Mariano Rivera (42), Andy Pettitte (46) and Ron Guidry (49); managers/coaches Joe Torre (6) and Casey Stengel (37).\nOakland Athletics: (1901; Western Division): An original Major League Baseball franchise, the Athletics began in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (winning three World Series between 1910 to 1913 -- again in 1929 and 1930). The “A’s” moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955 and then on to Oakland, California at the start of the 1968 season. The early days of the Oakland Athletics saw three straight World Series championships (1972, 1973 and 1974).\nRetired numbers include: outfielders Reggie Jackson (9) and Rickey Henderson (24); pitchers Jim “Catfish” Hunter (27), Rollie Fingers (34) and Dennis Eckersley (43). There are no retired numbers from when the Athletics played in Philadelphia or Kansas City. However, the Oakland team displays all of the Hall-of-Fame Philadelphia Athletics players’ numbers and World Series Championships honors at their stadium (Oakland Alameda Coliseum).\nSeattle Mariners (1977; Western Division): The Mariners franchise was actually created as the result of a lawsuit, after the Seattle Pilots were sold and relocated to Milwaukee (to become the Brewers). In 1970, the city of Seattle (King County and the state of Washington) sued the American League for breach of contract -- the issue, in part, centered on a league stipulation that the city of Seattle build a new stadium for the Pilots. (Seattle eventually built the Kingdome*). In 1976, with the case finally going to trial, the American League offered the city of Seattle an expansion team as a settlement to the lawsuit. (The AL would expand to create two new franchises -- the other went to the Toronto Blue Jays). The new Seattle Mariners took the field in 1977. As of this writing, the Mariners have not retired any player numbers.\n* In 1970, when the Pilots were sold (and moved to Milwaukee), the city of Seattle, King County and the state of Washington sued the American League -- requesting $32 million dollars in damages. Seattle’s attorneys claimed that the AL urged and sponsored the city’s “financial commitments,” (including building the new stadium for the Pilots). The plaintiffs thought by the American League allowing the Pilots to move to Milwaukee, the league should pay for at least part of the new stadium. (The Kingdome would be used for NFL football, too -- the Seattle Seahawks). The Kingdome was ready for its tenants in March, 1976, but it had no baseball team until the Mariners came to be in 1977.\nTampa Bay Rays (1998; Eastern Division): This expansion team started out as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays but the name changed to the Rays in 2008. There is no actual city called “Tampa Bay\" -- the name is used to describe the geographical location of the team (the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, Bradenton and Clearwater). Numbers retired by the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays: infielder Wade Boggs (12) and coach Don Zimmer (66).\nTexas Rangers (1961 Western Division): This franchise began in Washington D.C. as the Washington Senators (1961-1971). Not to be confused with the original Washington Senators (that eventually became the Minnesota Twins), this 1961 Senators team was an expansion franchise for Major League Baseball; the club moved to Arlington, Texas prior to the start of the 1972 season. The Texas Rangers have retired these numbers: manager Johnny Oates (26) and pitcher Nolan Ryan (34).\nToronto Blue Jays (1977: Eastern Division): The expansion Toronto Blue Jays began their franchise tenure with home games at the Canadian National Exhibition Stadium before moving to SkyDome in 1989 (SkyDome was renamed to Rogers Centre in 2006). As of this writing (in addition to Major League Baseball’s retirement of number 42 in honor of Jackie Robinson), the Toronto Blue Jays have retired number 12 for infielder Roberto Alomar.\nToday’s Baseball League Lineup\nAmerican League Eastern Division: Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays and Toronto Blue Jays.\nAmerican League Central Division: Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals and Minnesota Twins.\nAmerican League Western Division: Houston Astros, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers.\nNational League Eastern Division: Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Nationals.\nNational League Central Division: Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.\nNational League Western Division: Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants.\nThe Season of Baseball\nThere are 30 teams in Major League Baseball -- each plays a 162-game season; the total number of regular season scheduled games for both the American League and the National League is 2,430. (Postponed games are usually made up during the season; however, there may be exceptions because of scheduling or other reasons as noted by Major League Baseball).\nThe regular season lasts from early April to late September, followed by divisional and championship playoffs and the World Series through October (and sometimes into early November). The Divisional Series can last up to 5 games; the Championship Series up to 7 games; and the World Series can run up to 7 games, if necessary.\nWhether played by professionals, amateurs, students or enjoyed by spectators, the sport of baseball is a part of American culture. The momentum of professional baseball begins with Spring Training and runs throughout the season to the Fall Classic -- the World Series.\nDuring the winter months, true baseball enthusiasts dream of the new season to come. It’s never too far away!\n© 2016 Teri Silver"}

{"text": "Pill could treat degenerative brain conditions\nPublished: 25 July 2012\nA single pill has the potential to treat multiple brain conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis, it has been revealed.\nScientists have developed a new class of drug which can be taken orally and prevents the damaging effects of inflammation in the brain.\nEarly results from animal studies suggest it could be effective against a plethora of devastating brain conditions.\nThey include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), motor neurone disease, frontotemporal dementia, and complications from traumatic brain injury.\nTwo of the drugs, known as MW151 and MW189, have been patented by US scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago.\nThey work by blocking excess production of damaging immune system signalling molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nNew research published in the Journal of Neuroscience showed how early treatment with MW151 prevented the development of full-blown Alzheimer's in laboratory mice.\nScientists say the drugs offer a completely different approach to treating the disease to others currently being tested.\nThese target the accumulation of beta amyloid protein deposits in the brain which are a key feature of Alzheimer's.\nIn contrast the new drugs are designed to stop inflammation disrupting wiring in the brain and killing neurons.\nPro-inflammatory cytokines cause the synapses, the connections between brain cells, to misfire. Eventually the whole organisation of the brain falls into disarray, like a failing computer, and neurons die.\n\"In Alzheimer's disease, many people now view the progression from mild cognitive impairment to full-blown Alzheimer's as an indication of malfunctioning synapses, the pathways that allow neurons to talk to each other,\" said Professor Martin Watterson, one of the study leaders at Northwestern University's Feinberg School.\n\"High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can contribute to synaptic malfunction.\"\nMice genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's were given MW151 three times a week starting at six months of age. A comparable stage in humans would be when a patient begins to experience mild mental decline.\nAt 11 months, by which time the mice should have developed full-blown Alzheimer's, cytokine levels in the brains of the animals were found to be back to normal. Their synapses were also working normally.\nUntreated mice had abnormally high brain levels of cytokines and their synapses were misfiring.\nCo-author Dr Linda Van Eldik, director of the Sanders-Brown Centre on Aging at the University of Kentucky, said: \"The drug protected against the damage associated with learning and memory impairment. Giving this drug before Alzheimer's memory changes are at a late stage may be a promising future approach to therapy.\"\nHarmful inflammation also plays a role in a wide range of other neurodegenerative disorders, raising the prospect of using the drug to treat many different conditions.\nEarlier tests on mice showed that MW151 reduced the severity of a disease similar to MS in humans that strips nerve fibres of their insulating myelin covering.\nIn other mouse experiments, the drug prevented a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines after traumatic brain injury.\n\"If you took a drug like this early on after traumatic brain injury or even a stroke, you could possibly prevent the long-term complications of that injury including the risk of seizures, cognitive impairment, and, perhaps, mental health issues,\" said Professor Mark Wainright, also from Northwestern's Feinberg School.\nParkinson's, non-Alzheimer's dementia and motor neurone disease were other conditions that could potentially be tackled using the new approach.\nA key advantage of the drug is that it can be swallowed as a pill, rather than being injected. It easily crosses the \"blood brain barrier\", a physical and molecular fortress wall that stops toxic molecules entering the brain.\nResults are yet to be released from the first Phase I trial assessing the drug's safety in human patients.\nThis is the first step in winning clinical approval for a new treatment.\nDr Simon Ridley, head of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This research takes an interesting approach to tackling Alzheimer's. Most current therapies in development target amyloid, whereas this drug appears to act by reducing the damage caused by activation of the immune system.\n\"We know that the immune system and inflammation are important players in Alzheimer's disease and so it's promising to see that this approach could hold benefits.\n\"These are early findings in mice and the drugs would need to be tested in humans before we could judge their true potential as a new treatment. With over half a million people in the UK living with Alzheimer's, effective new therapies are vital.\n\"Research is key to reaching this goal and we must keep investing in fresh ideas and new strategies if we are to tackle this devastating disease head-on.\"\nTop stories in News\nNews in Pictures\nTop stories in News\nNews in Pictures\n- Sky at night: amazing photographs from London's aerial photographer\n- Theatre bosses defiantly say 'the show must go on' after Apollo ceiling collapse\n- More than 30 injured after double decker bus crashes into tree in Kennington\n- Grace Dent's worst London restaurants of 2013\n- Party people - the stars out in London\n- Lorries to trial top-down CCTV system to cut London bike deaths\n- 'Domino's Pizza exploits Lithuanians living 12 to a flat', says Nigel Farage in scathing attack on chain\n- Family 'devastated' after British doctor Abbas Khan dies in a Syrian jail\n- BBC defends itself over Radio 4 interview with Anjem Choudary\n- Matthew Perry and Peter Hitchens go head-to-head in fierce Newsnight debate on drugs\nAs this week is Road Safety Week, Specsavers is giving away a free children's high visibility vest to parents and guardians.\nTake our short survey for your opportunity to win one of two £100 Amazon vouchers.\nNCP has reduced the cost of parking at their most popular London car parks* for shopping, restaurants and theatres and costs just £5 when you pre-book online.\nCirque du Soleil invites you to experience the journey of a young girl into a world beyond imagination, from 4 January 2014 at the Royal Albert Hall.\nClick here for the capital’s click-to-buy fashion edit.\nTake our survey for your chance to win 4 tickets to a mystery London event."}

{"text": "As a blue-collar Irish-American neighborhood, Dogtown is one of the few remaining old-time, \"ethnic neighborhoods\" in the country.\nThere aren't many places like Dogtown left in St. Louis - or the United States for that matter. As a blue-collar, Irish-American neighborhood, it is one of the few remaining old-time, \"ethnic communities\" in the country. This is a distinction that most Dogtowners seem to be very proud of, and as a result many are interested in preserving it - or at least proudly displaying it. In fact, whether you're sipping a stout at Seamus McDaniel's or Pat's Bar and Grill, attending the neighborhood St. Patrick's Day parade, or just walking down the street, it's impossible to escape a slew of shamrocks, Irish flags, and other nostalgic displays of Irish culture. It indeed seems to be a place that is deeply rooted in its heritage.\nHowever, an interesting thing happens when you ask a Dogtowner to discuss anything related to Ireland; more often than not, they know nothing of the place., You won't hear a rant on Irish politics or an explanation of Irish literature. Some couldn't even tell you that Dublin is the capitol. How can people know so little about the identity that they cling to so fiercely?\nBob Corbett pondered this question for some time. Bob, who’s 63, was born into a family that had lived in the neighborhood for four generations. He grew up there until he was 22 and then decided to set off on his own. For the better part of thirty years he divided his time between traveling the world, practicing charity, and sporadically heading up the philosophy department at Webster University. He did not return to Dogtown until about ten years ago. He since has moved back into the home that he grew up in and now dedicates most of his time to researching Dogtown history.\n\"Growing up here, we knew nothing about Ireland, but we lived the life of Irish villagers becasue that was the part of the culture that was handed down to us.\"\nNeedless to say, Bob knows plenty about Irish culture, among other things, but Bob’s story is different than most Dogtowners’. Many people his age, and older, have never lived anywhere else, and most Dogtown residents are working class. This is not a neighborhood where philosophers are found sipping coffee and discussing Heidegger (or European history for that matter); Dogtown is more of a beer and baseball kind of place. Nevertheless, while the neighborhood hardly has a scholarly air about it, it’s presumable that people would at least know something about Ireland, especially when the place truly does feel so “Irish”. Interestingly, Bob and his brother, John, were talking recently and had a revelation. They realized that even though most folks in the neighborhood know very little about Irish culture, they still practice the Irish lifestyle. The values of Dogtowners have always been based upon distinctive elements like family, community, and Catholicism – principles that still govern the typical rural, Irish communities of today. “Growing up here, we knew nothing about Ireland,” Bob says, “But we lived the life of Irish villagers because that was the part of the culture that was handed down to us. Though we didn’t eat the food, read the literature, or speak Gaelic, we lived the fundamental lifestyle found in Ireland…and we still do.” In the mid 1800s, when waves of immigrants (a majority of whom were Irish) began settling in the area to work in clay mines, brick factories, and other forms of industry, they created an environment that felt like home. Their community was formed around a Catholic Church, St. James the Greater (still the heart and soul of the Dogtown in the eyes of many), and a sense of camaraderie was instilled in the neighborhood. Though certain particulars of that culture were lost over the years, the core principles of those first settlers have been retained. In Dogtown, people still rally around their families, their neighbors, and the Vatican.\nFor Dogtowners, sustaining this way of life is essential to the future of their community. Whether they’re restoring old photographs or doing genealogy projects, people from the neighborhood often show a desire to preserve their heritage. Though Joe Finn, owner of Pat’s Bar and Grill, was originally from the Central West End, even he has been caught up in this sentiment. Joe was a stockbroker who had become a fixture at Pat’s. There he was among of a group of regulars, some that had been sitting at the bar for the better part of fifty years. One of them was Paul Jovonovich (or “PJ”), who then owned Pat’s with his wife, Teresa Connolly, the daughter of Pat himself. When PJ died almost ten years ago, Joe felt compelled to do something to keep Pat’s afloat. He first helped Teresa by bartending at night after work, and once Teresa had grown tired of owning the bar alone, Joe offered to buy it from her. Teresa probably could have sold the place to a higher bidder, but she knew that Joe would keep the spirit of the Pat’s alive – so Joe left his nice desk job and moved to Dogtown to run a bar that is the size of many stockbrokers’ living rooms. Now, despite long hours and constant headaches, Joe finds that his choice has been very rewarding. He considers himself to be more of a caretaker than a business owner, and he knows that when he also has had enough, he’ll look for someone else that will keep the tradition going. “There is a camaraderie here that you don’t find in most places,” he says. “It’s neat because people in Dogtown aren’t rich and aren’t necessarily trying to be. Things like family and friendship are much more important here than they are in mainstream America.” People living in Dogtown would like keep things that way.\nHowever, as more communities in St. Louis are either gentrified or mainstreamed, it’s safe to say that the Dogtown way of life will face increasing challenges as time goes on. That’s why the efforts of those like Joe Finn and Bob Corbett are so important. Bob, in fact, is now trying to recruit others to help him preserve the neighborhood’s history. He has recently helped found “The Dogtown Historical Society”, a small group (for now) that is dedicated to doing profound historical research and moving beyond the nostalgia that many Dogtowners indulge in. Additionally, he runs an e-mail discussion list on Dogtown history that is accessed by hundreds of people daily.\nWhen asked why he initiated his history effort, Bob notes that it is his way of sharing his talents with the community. “I need to have a sense that I’m giving something,” he says. “Once I came back to Dogtown, I needed a way to contribute to the neighborhood. I felt that by doing this – by helping raise peoples’ consciousness about their community and its history, I might be helping the neighborhood grow.”\nIt is this sense of heritage and this spirit of generosity that makes Dogtown a distinctive place. The community serves as a reminder that in embracing our past, we can improve our future.\n|Bibliography||Oral history||Recorded history||Photos|\n|YOUR page||External links||Walking Tour|"}

{"text": "Dr. T.B. Jayah together with A.M. A. Azeez has been recognized as the two Principals who were responsible for the emergence of Zahira College, Colombo as one of the leading schools in the country. Jayah was also an active politician who contested and won a seat in Parliament during his tenure as Principal from 1931 to 1948.\nAfter one such election the management of the school wanted him to take action against a member of the teaching staff who had worked against Jayah at the elections and supported a leftist candidate instead. Jayah point blank refused and said that the teacher’s political affiliations and conduct were irrelevant and since the individual concerned was an excellent teacher that was all that mattered. One cannot think of a better example of democracy at work and upholding of the principle that one cannot be punished for the views that one holds.\nIn the 60s the traditional picture on the front page of the Daily News on the day following every General Election was that of Dudley Senanayake and Dr. N.M.Perera-the bitterest of political foes with divergent views- enjoying a hearty chat while waiting for results at the Kegalle Kachcheri. In the days preceding the Election the two would have critiqued each other’s policies in the strongest possible terms but never once descending to personal recrimination. They disagreed with each other’s political ideologies but always respected the other’s views. This was an era when political parties campaigned on a policy platform and did not label those who differed from their views as traitors.\nUnfortunately today we have come a full circle and Elections have become a crude and acrimonious personal battle bereft of policy debate, thus diminishing democracy no end. Any difference of opinion-even when articulated with the best of intentions-is taken personally and frowned upon. Political leaders far from encouraging diversity of opinions as an enriching process in political debate rather give recognition to sycophants who are a dime a dozen today.\nThe culture of intolerance has taken root in our polity and no one is immune from it. General Sarath Fonseka who was hailed as a war hero and as the main or one of the main figures in the successful campaign against the LTTE is currently demeaned and ridiculed from each and every possible platform. Today he is under custody without any charges being preferred against him despite a whole range of disparate allegations made against him during the past few weeks from public platforms.\nAs Ranil Wickremesinghe said at a public meeting the other day the usual practice in law enforcement is to find evidence and then arrest the accused, but in this case the reverse process is being followed.\nGeneral Sarath Fonseka’s real crime seems to be that he dared to contest the Presidential Elections. Otherwise how does one explain the selective efficiency of the law enforcing agencies which have made little or no progress in respect of many grave crimes committed during the past few years but shown great urgency in investigating alleged violations of the law by General Fonseka?\n|File photo: President J.R. Jayewardene greeting Left leader Dr. N.M. Perera.\nEven the Venerable Mahanayake Theras who were aghast at the treatment meted out to the defeated Presidential candidate were prevented from holding a Conference of Buddhist clergy to express their views on the matter.\nThe fact that religious leaders of such high standing too became victim to the intolerant political culture of our times signifies the parlous state of our democracy. But what is even more depressing when viewed from the point of view of the national interest is that those sections of society who have the sacred duty to stand up against injustice are not only silent but sometimes even justify such injustice. Academics and professionals who by the very nature of their calling are best suited to stand up and be counted prefer instead to sell their souls to their political masters and be unrepentant sycophants.\nThe only two exceptions that this writer has noticed are Dr. Dayan Jayetilleke and Professor Carlo Fonseka who despite being strong supporters of the Government have publicly expressed disquiet at the manner in which General Fonseka has been treated.\nThe Bar Association in particular has been remiss in its loud silence while inroads were being made into the Rule of Law and Constitutional provisions violated. It was tragic to see the Bar Association suddenly swinging into action recently to protest against a demonstration near the precincts of the Courts in Hulftsdorp having remained mute and inactive on much larger issues that affected the national interest.\nIt is not as if academics and professionals are not entitled to political views or to support political parties of their choice. But when issues involving the national interest arise one expects them to act objectively in a manner befitting their chosen vocations giving precedence to the national interest over political partisanship.\nOnly such intellectuals understand that dissent is never a factor that undermines the progress of a country. Diversity of views is always a source of empowerment and it is only a clash of ideas that ensures and results in a country’s growth and development.\nComments maybe addressed to email@example.com."}

{"text": "The rising price of oil has a negative impact on our economy and threatens to stifle our anemic recovery from the government produced and bureaucratically fostered Great Recession. How did we get here? Has anyone ever pinpointed the problem beyond blaming speculators and rising demand? Has anyone shown us how our energy independence could be achieved?\nRemember the 1973 oil embargo? This was our first oil shock. How did it come about and what did we do about it? Did these policies solve the problem?\nIn 1973, the U.S. and the Western world were experiencing an accelerating inflationary spiral. Twenty years of prosperity and accelerating population growth created heavy need for raw materials that were not being produced internally which made them highly vulnerable to commodity cartels. Due to the fall in domestic production mainly because of the powerful man-made global warming lobby, the demand for Middle Eastern oil increased. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), formed in 1960, determined to increase its profits at the expense of the West grew stronger.\nPresident Nixon, in an attempt to control inflation, imposed price controls on oil in March 1973. The U.S. which has the world’s largest reserves of oil had been self-sufficient in energy up until the late 1950s was by the 1970s importing over 35% of its energy needs. Through the lack of planning U.S. petroleum reserves were depleted and the pride that goes before a fall led our government, corporations, and individuals to be entirely unprepared for the radical change about to take place.\nOn the Jewish high holy day of Yom Kippur October 6, 1973,, Egyptian forces attacked Israel across the Suez Canal, while at the same time Syrian troops attacked the Golan Heights. With help from the U.S., Israeli forces succeeded in pushing into both Syria and Egypt until a cease fire saved both Arab regimes. On October 17, OPEC struck back imposing a total oil embargo on the U.S. and increasing prices by 70% on Western Europe, and overnight the price of a barrel of oil to these nations more than triples going from $3 to $5.11.\nThis led to a series of presidential statements and actions, all aimed at rallying the American people in the face of growing dependency and international impotence in the energy sector.\nRichard Nixon said, “Let us set as our national goal, in the spirit of Apollo, with the determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign energy source.”\nPresident Gerald Ford said, “I am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign oil. … new stand-by emergency programs to achieve the independence we want…”\nPresident Jimmy Carter said, achieving energy independence was the “moral equivalent of war.”\nRonald Reagan, always looking for the free market approach said we should look to, “native American genius, not arbitrary federal policy, to be free to provide for our energy future.”\nIn 1991, in the prelude to the First Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush announced, “There is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil.”\nIn 2000, President Clinton said, “The nation’s growing reliance on imports threatens the nation’s security because it increases U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruptions.”\nGeorge W. Bush repeated recent presidential history by insisting, in his 2003 State of the Union address, that one of his administration’s goals was “to promote energy independence for our country.”\nMr. Obama continued the chorus saying, “America’s dependence on oil is one of the most serious threats that our nation has faced.”\nDid any President ever have an energy policy which effectively dealt with the problems of oil production and supply?\nReagan said, “The best answer, while conservation is worthy in itself, is to try to make us independent of outside sources to the greatest extent possible for our energy.”\nRonald Reagan also said, “Our national energy plan should not be a rigid set of production and conservation goals dictated by Government. Our primary objective is simply for our citizens to have enough energy, and it is up to them to decide how much energy that is, and in what form and manner it will reach them. When the free market is permitted to work the way it should, millions of individual choices and judgments will produce the proper balance of supply and demand our economy needs. ”\nAs soon as he became president, Ronald Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil first imposed by Richard Nixon; these controls had contributed to both the 1973 Oil Crisis and the 1979 Energy Crisis. Almost immediately the price of oil fell, and during the 1980s America didn’t experience the gasoline lines and fuel shortages of the 1970s. In addition, the removal of price controls ignited a boom in domestic drilling which arrested America’s slide into energy dependence.\nAs to the energy questions: How do we end our dependence on foreign oil? How can we achieve the energy independence which every President since Nixon has said is a matter of national security? Stop wringing our hands and moaning about our situation, stand up like our ancestors have and boldly declare our energy independence! In practical terms we should: take the shackles off our domestic oil industry, build new refineries, develop better distribution of natural gas, expand the use of nuclear, wind, solar and every conceivable form of energy, and drill baby drill!\nThen in this new situation with America reaping the benefits, the jobs, the growth of a renewed sense of freedom and security let’s barter. One barrel of oil = one bushel of wheat.\nDr. Robert R. Owens teaches history, political science, religion, and leadership for Southside Virginia Community College. Dr. Owens is the author of “America Won the Vietnam War,” “The Asuza Street Revival,” and called “The Constitution Failed.” He is available for speaking engagements."}
{"text": "As I study for the Young Harris course, I'm learning some interesting bee biology facts:\n- The bee is a highly efficient insect - each leg has a specific job - the hind leg has the corbicula (the pollen basket) on the tibia. While not a \"basket,\" it is a concave region with hairs around the edges and a central bristle that anchors the pollen loads. The middle leg cleans the thoracic hairs and moves pollen from the front to the hind legs. (There's a blind spot on the middle leg that the bee cannot clean which often has pollen dusted on it as the bee returns to the hive). The front leg has hair on the basitarsus that cleans the dust, pollen, etc from the head. The foreleg has an antenna cleaner on it (a hook of sorts) that cleans the antenna\n- When the adult bee emerges from the cell in which she has pupated, she attaches the capping to the side of the cell. Workers come along and recycle the capping on another cell!\n- Bee brood has a good chance of survival. Drone cells on the outside edges of the frame\nhave a lower survival rate - since we know temperature is a factor, the edges probably are less warm. Also the workers remove brood that is the result of the queen mating with one of her brothers. This accounts for some of the empty cells you might see in an otherwise good brood pattern.\n- Bees are \"eusocial.\" To qualify for this term, bees must have cooperative brood care (bees take care of young that isn't their own), reproductive division of labor (sterile females take care of the young that the fertile queen produces), and overlapping generations (in the bee hive, this means that the older sisters care for their younger sisters).\n- The queen larva is fed ten times as often as worker larvae. Winston says that \"queens literally swim in a sea of brood food.\"\n- How do bees signal that they want food from another bee? \"The begging bee thrusts the tip of her tongue toward the mouth of another bee.\"\nThe feeding bee then opens her jaws (her mandibles) and pushes her own tongue toward the begging bee. Then the feeding bee brings a drop of liquid up from her honey stomach for the begging bee. This is called trophallaxis."}

{"text": "FLUORIDE Overview Information\nFluoride is a form of the chemical element fluorine. It is used as medicine.\nFluoride is added to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay. Children who do not drink fluorinated public water because their homes use water from a private well often take fluoride tablets to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is added to toothpaste and mouthwashes so it can be applied directly to the teeth to prevent tooth decay.\nFluoride is also taken by mouth for treating weakened bones (osteoporosis) and for preventing bone loss in people with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.\nHow does it work?\nFluoride protects teeth from the bacteria in plaque. It also promotes new bone formation. This is different than most medicines used for weak bones (osteoporosis), which fight osteoporosis by keeping bone from being broken down.\n- Preventing tooth decay, when fluoride is added to drinking water or included in toothpastes, mouthwashes, and other dental products.\nPossibly Effective for:\n- Treating osteoporosis (bone loss). Fluoride taken by mouth continuously or cyclically (three months on, one month off) might increase bone mineral density, which is an indicator of bone strength. Fluoride seems to work better for improving bone strength in older women when combined with hormone replacement therapy. However, it’s not clear whether taking fluoride actually reduces the chance of weak bones breaking.\n- Preventing bone loss in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Preventing bone loss in people with Crohn's disease (an intestinal disorder).\n- Other conditions.\nFLUORIDE Side Effects & Safety\nFluoride is safe for most people in the amounts added to public water supplies and used in toothpastes and mouthwashes, and applied by dentists. Low doses (up to 20 mg per day of elemental fluoride) of supplemental fluoride taken by mouth appear to be safe for most people. Higher doses are UNSAFE and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems. High doses of fluoride in children before their permanent teeth come through the gums can cause tooth discoloration.\nToothpaste and fluoride rinses should not be swallowed routinely, particularly by children. It’s a good idea to make sure that children under six years of age use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste, just in case they swallow some.\nSpecial Precautions & Warnings:Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Fluoride seems to be safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding when taken in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg per day of elemental fluoride and when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes. But higher doses are UNSAFE and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.\nThe following doses have been studied in scientific research:\n- To prevent tooth decay (dental caries): in the US, fluoride is added to city water to a concentration of 0.7 to 1.2 parts per million (ppm). To prevent dental caries in areas where the fluoride level in drinking water is less than 0.3 ppm (such as in well water), children 6 months to 3 years should receive a fluoride supplement of 0.25 mg per day; children 3 to 6 years, 0.5 mg per day; and children 6 to 16 years, 1 mg per day. For children living in areas where the fluoride level is 0.3 to 0.6 ppm, children 3 to 6 years should receive 0.25 mg per day, and children 6 to 16 years, 0.5 mg per day. No supplement is needed in areas where the fluoride in drinking water exceeds 0.6 ppm.\n- For treating weak bones (osteoporosis): 15 to 20 mg per day of elemental fluoride.\nThe daily upper intake levels (UL) for fluoride, the highest level at which no harmful effects are expected, are 0.7 mg for infants birth through 6 months; 0.9 mg for infants 7 through 12 months; 1.3 mg for children 1 through 3 years; 2.2 mg for children 4 through 8 years and 10 mg for children older than 8 years, adults, and pregnant and breast feeding women.\nSodium fluoride contains 45% elemental fluoride. Monofluorophosphate contains 19% elemental fluoride."}
{"text": "From Our 2010 Archives\nPremature Birth Rate Is Dropping\nStudy Also Shows a Decline in the Birth Rate for Teenagers\nReviewed By Louise Chang, MD\nJuly 9, 2010 -- The rate of premature births has dropped slightly for the second year in a row, according to a new federal report.\nWhat is more, the rate of births to teens also has declined, the study shows.\nThe report, \"America's Children in Brief: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2010,\" finds that in the period 2007-2008:\n\"The decline in preterm births is encouraging,\" Alan E. Guttmacher, MD, acting director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development, says in a news release. \"Preterm infants are at higher risk for death in the first year of life, for serious illness in infancy, and in later life, for obesity and its associated complications.\"\nEdward Sondik, PhD, director of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, says in the same news release that the decline in births to teens is significant because it occurred after two years of increases.\nReading and Math Improvements\nThe report also shows improvements in children's education, including higher reading and math scores for eighth graders. In the period from 2007 to 2009:\nGuttmacher said in a telephone news briefing that the federal report presents 40 indicators of child well-being, including family and social environment, economic circumstances, health care, physical environment and safety, behavior, education, and health.\nHe says the drop in preterm births was mostly in later pregnancy -- those that occur at 34-36 weeks of gestation.\nHe says it's unclear why the rate of preterm births dropped, but that this matter is being investigated with a view toward further reducing the preterm birth rate.\nSondik says the decline in preterm births was seen in each of the three largest racial and ethnic groups, and that though small, \"even a slight decrease in preterm birth is positive.\"\nDespite improvements, however, he says about 136,000 babies were born to mothers 15-27 in 2008.\nThe research also sheds light on trends for unmarried mothers:\n\"Looking at the data by income status for children in poverty, the percentage with untreated cavities was twice that of children who lived in families with incomes at or above 200% of the poverty level,\" Sondik says. \"However, the percentage with untreated cavities declined across the board for all income levels.\"\nThe obesity rate for children today is triple what it was from 1976 to 1980, Sondik says.\nHe also points out that the percentage of teens who regularly smoke cigarettes is at its lowest level since data collection began in 1980.\nIn 2009, less than 3% of eighth graders reported smoking cigarettes every day, down from 10% in the mid-1990s. He says 6% of 10th graders smoked in 2009, about a third the rate of the mid-1990s, and 11% of 12th graders smoked daily, down from 25% in 1997.\nIn 2008, the researchers say, 90% of young adults had a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, up from 84% in 1980.\nSOURCES: News release, National Institutes of Health."}

{"text": "Orbital Sciences Corp. has successfully launched its first Minotaur V rocket from Pad 0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Va., carrying NASA’s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft on a multi-month journey to explore the mysteries of the Moon. Liftoff of the five-stage Minotaur—which represents a marriage of the lower three stages of the Peacekeeper missile, topped by the Star-48V motor of the fourth stage and a spin-stabilized Star-37FM of the fifth—occurred precisely on time at 11:27 p.m. EDT Friday, 6 September. Separation of LADEE in orbit was confirmed by NASA at 11:50 p.m., and the spacecraft will now execute a series of “phasing loops” to reach the vicinity of the Moon in early October.\nThe final days leading up to this mission have proceeded without incident, and on Wednesday the gantry at Pad 0B was rolled back to expose the giant Minotaur V. Last night offered virtually perfect conditions for liftoff on the Wallops stretch of the Virginia coast, with weather classified as “Green” throughout the final minutes and no technical issues being tracked by either the Launch Vehicle (LV) or Spacecraft (SC) teams. At 11:15 p.m., the Minotaur’s flight computer was loaded with the T-0 liftoff time and the Flight Termination System (FTS)—which would destroy the vehicle in the event of a dire, off-nominal situation—was armed and transferred to internal power. Shortly afterwards, final weather checks were made, and at T-2 minutes the Launch Computer assumed primary control of the countdown, producing a picture-perfect, on-time liftoff.\nThe Minotaur V’s SR-118 first-stage engine was responsible for the start of a fast climb away from Pad 0B at the MARS site, which supported its fifth total launch by a member of the Minotaur rocket family. Since Pad 0B was declared operational in 1999, and received a mobile service tower following lengthy modifications in 2004, it supported a Minotaur I mission in December 2006 to insert the U.S. Air Force’s TacSat-2 experimental payload and the NASA/academia-developed GeneSat-1 microsatellite into orbit. The pad was later used for three further Minotaur I launches in April 2007, May 2009, and June 2011. These lofted the Missile Defense Agency’s Near Infrared Field Experiment (NFIRE), the Air Force’s TacSat-3 technology reconnaissance payload, and the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS)-1 satellite—subsequently named USA-231—for the Department of Defense’s Operationally Responsive Space Office.\nAs noted by Spaceflight101, the SR-118 burned for almost a minute and achieved an altitude of about 14 miles, after which the SR-119 second stage engine ignited to continue the climb uphill. This engine also fired for around a minute and, upon exhaustion, was separated and replaced by the burn of the SR-120 third stage. Whilst it was burning, the payload fairing was jettisoned to expose the LADEE spacecraft to the harsh space environment, and the separation of the third stage—the final component of the vehicle to originate from Peacekeeper missile hardware—was confirmed at 11:31 p.m. The Minotaur/LADEE combo then “coasted,” with the deactivation of the FTS and activation of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) transmitter, ahead of the ignition of the Star-48V-powered fourth stage at 11:34 p.m.\nWithin minutes, tracking passed from the Bermuda ground station to the geosynchronous-orbiting TDRS network of NASA communications and relay satellites. The fourth stage separated at 11:41 p.m. and the fifth stage—propelled by the Star-37FM motor—ignited at 11:44 p.m., spinning LADEE up to 60 revolutions per minute for stabilization and insertion into Lunar Transfer Orbit (LTO). By this point, as reported by NASASpaceflight.com, the Minotaur V/LADEE combo had reached an altitude well in excess of 125 miles and were traveling at an estimated 6.5 miles per second. Following the burnout of the fifth stage, a “Yo-Yo” system despun the payload, ahead of LADEE’s separation, which was confirmed by NASA at 11:50 p.m. By now, the spacecraft had reached an altitude of about 380 miles. Initial communications checks and, as described by Spaceflight101, the separation event was monitored through TDRS, and initial LADEE communications acquisition occurred through the Hartebeesthoek ground station in South Africa.\nAt present, the spacecraft resides in a highly-elliptical Earth orbit, with an apogee of about 50 Earth-radii, and will be gradually maneuvered to lunar distance through a series of three propellant-saving “phasing loops” over the next three weeks. On Thursday, 12 September, LADEE should complete the first (or “A1″) loop, after which the spacecraft will ignite its main engine to increase its velocity and modify its apogee. The next stage will be the eight-day-long A2 loop, after which the final ten-day A3 loop will create an apogee condition of slightly greater than lunar distance. Coupled with propulsive maneuvering burns, this will enable the Moon’s gravity to capture LADEE.\n“All of LADEE’s mission events, except the lunar gravitational capture, are made using the propulsion system to maneuver the spacecraft,” explained NASA’s mission press kit. “The Minotaur V launch vehicle will execute a Phasing Orbit Insertion burn to place LADEE on the first phasing loop; however, all maneuvers after that will be done using LADEE’s on-board bi-propellant propulsion system. The first phasing orbit maneuver is scheduled to occur approximately six days after launch. The LADEE spacecraft will orbit Earth three times in a highly elliptical orbit, making trajectory corrections on each pass, if necessary. On the final phasing loop orbit, LADEE’s on-board propulsion subsystem will add enough energy to the orbit until the Moon’s gravity can take over and LADEE begins its approach trajectory to the Moon.”\nThe spacecraft will thus coast to our closest celestial neighbor, rotating slowly about its longitudinal axis, which will be oriented toward ecliptic-North, almost perpendicular to both the Sun and the Earth. Upon arrival at the Moon in early October, LADEE will execute a three-minute Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) maneuver, which will inject it into an elliptical retrograde equatorial orbit, with a period of about 24 hours. This will be steadily reduced to an almost-circular path at an altitude of 156 miles, selected due to its suitability for communications visibility to Earth during the maneuvering phase and to minimize the need for further maneuvers during LADEE’s Commissioning Phase.\nAbout 30 days into the mission, the spacecraft will begin the 40-day Commissioning Phase, during which LADEE’s scientific instruments and the LLCD technology demonstrator will be checked out. In the final few days of this phase, the spacecraft will steadily lower its orbit, initially to about 46.6 miles and eventually into the “science phase” orbit of between 31-93 miles. “Due to the unevenness of the Moon’s gravitational field,” noted NASA’s press kit, “the orbit requires significant orbit maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every 3-5 days or as infrequently as once every two weeks. Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers will be used to keep LADEE’s lowest altitude above 31 miles and highest altitude below 93 miles to the extent possible.” During the 100-day Science Phase, the Moon will rotate more than three times under the spacecraft’s orbit.\nThe spacecraft’s arrival, on about 6 October, is expected to herald a period of several months spent studying the thin atmosphere and dust environment of our closest celestial neighbor in unrivaled depth. Led by NASA’s Ames Research Center of Moffett Field, Calif., together with the Goddard Space Flight Center of Greenbelt, Md., the $280 million LADEE mission will be placed into a near-circular equatorial orbit with a final “Science Phase” altitude of 31-93 miles above the Moon. The spacecraft will utilize a Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), a Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), and an Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer (UVS) to determine the density and composition of the Moon’s atmosphere, as well as helping to determine if observations by Apollo astronauts of diffuse, high-altitude emissions were due to “sodium glow” or dust and documenting the dust-impactor environment to guide plans for future missions.\n“The Moon’s tenuous atmosphere may be more common in the Solar System than we thought,” said former astronaut John Grunsfeld, now NASA’s associate administrator for science in Washington, D.C. “Further understanding of the Moon’s atmosphere may also help us better understand our diverse Solar System and its evolution.”\nNASA-Ames has overall responsibility for the operation of the LADEE spacecraft, while NASA-Goddard carries oversight of the scientific sensors and technology payloads. The latter includes an experimental laser communications (or “lasercom”) terminal, known as the Lunar Laser Com Demo (LLCD), which will transmit and receive data as pulses of light from three ground stations. The 844-pound spacecraft measures 7.7 feet tall by 4.7 feet wide by 4.7 feet deep and will be powered by 30 panels of silicon cells on its exterior faces, together with a lithium-ion battery pack. LADEE completed the bulk of its pre-launch checkout earlier this year, with final thermal vacuum chamber tests conducted at NASA-Ames in April. The spacecraft was delivered to Wallops for final processing in early June. Encapsulated within its 7.7-foot-wide payload fairing, the spacecraft was stacked atop the Minotaur V on 27 August.\nAlthough last night’s launch was the 24th total mission by a member of the Minotaur rocket family—which first flew in the Minotaur I configuration from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., back in January 2000, lofting the Joint Air Force-Weber State University Satellite (JAWSAT) into low-Earth orbit—the LADEE flight was the first by the uprated Minotaur V. The new vehicle has been described by Orbital Sciences as “a five-stage evolutionary version of the Minotaur IV,” which has completed five flights between April 2010 and September 2011, staged from Vandenberg and from Kodiak Island, Alaska.\nAll five of the Minotaur V’s stages are solid-fueled. Its lower three stages are all former motors from the Peacekeeper missile family, with a launch record of over 50 missions apiece, whilst the upper two stages are commercial Star motors. “The Minotaur V concept leverages Orbital’s flight-proven heritage of the Minotaur family of launch vehicles to create a low-risk, readily-developed system,” noted Orbital’s Minotaur V fact sheet. “The Minotaur V avionics, structures, and fairing are common with the Minotaur IV, with relatively minor changes to create the five-stage configuration. Moreover, the avionics and flight software are highly common across all Minotaur launch vehicles.”"}

Small Business Expense Categories How To Categorize Small Business Expenses Why You Should Track Business Expenses Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Photo: Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images As a business owner, you must account for and manage several types of expenses in order to keep your operations running. Categorizing these expenses can help you effectively plan your finances, maintain an organized record of all transactions, and file taxes with ease. Understanding the key business expense categories can also make it easier to identify what is and isn’t tax deductible. In this article, we will discuss what these small business expenses are, how to categorize them, and how expense tracking can benefit your business. Key Takeaways Key expense categories for small businesses include utilities, insurance, and taxes. When categorizing and tracking expenses, business owners should consider setting up a separate bank account and using tracking software or apps.Tracking business expenses can offer several benefits including better preparing you for tax season and providing strategic opportunities for budget planning and tax deductions. What Are Tax-Deductible Business Expenses? Tax-deductible business expenses, or “tax write-offs,” are costs that business owners can deduct from their total revenue to determine their taxable income. In essence, tax-deductible business expenses can reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay for operating and profiting from your business. Here are some key examples of tax-deductible expenses: Business use of home and/or carDirect laborTaxesOffice or storage facility rent Insurance paymentsUtilities like phone bills, internet service, etc. Small Business Expense Categories Categorizing business expenses can make it easier to identify deductible items and file tax returns. Here are the main deductible expenses for small businesses to keep in mind. Taxes Business-related tax expenses like state and local sales tax, state and local income tax, personal property tax, and excise tax may be deductible. Utilities and Rent Expenses paid for utilities necessary for your business to remain operational can be deductible. These expenses can include your telephone, internet, and electricity bills, and rent paid for your office and additional storage space. Note If you work from home and use a home office setup, you can include the cost of a computer, mobile data plan, office chair, work desk, and similar expenses for tax deductions. Insurance The ordinary and necessary cost of insurance can be deducted as a business expense if it is specifically for your business or trade. Examples of tax-deductible insurance expenses include insurance premiums, general and professional liability insurance, commercial property insurance, and data breach insurance. Vehicle Expenses If you use a car or a similar vehicle for business purposes, cost of ownership and operations can be tax deductible. More specifically, the cost of gas, mileage from business use, parking fees and tolls, and depreciation (though there are certain criteria for the latter) can be considered deductible expenses. Compensation The wages you pay your employees or contractors for direct labor can count as a deductible business expense. How To Categorize Small Business Expenses Categorizing business expenses can be helpful, but it may feel challenging and overwhelming if you have never filed business taxes before. Whether you are a new business owner creating efficient systems for expense tracking, or a seasoned entrepreneur looking to change your financial records system, here are some ways to categorize small business expenses. Set Up a Separate Expense Account Setting up a separate bank account for handling specific business expenses can make tracking easier. For example, you can pay all your phone, internet, and electricity bills through a separate “Utilities” account. Use Online Apps and Software User-friendly (and often free) tracking apps and software can streamline the expense tracking and tax calculating process for small business owners. Instead of having to manually add to and maintain a spreadsheet or sort through a pen-and-paper trail of transactions, business owners can have an automated system to create invoice and expense reports, track expenses and time, and easily look up financial records and data. Note Examples of expense tracking software include SAP Concur, Expensify, Quickbooks, and Mint. Why You Should Track Business Expenses Tracking business expenses can help you in the following ways: Expense tracking helps you identify tax-deductible expenses and gets you better prepared for tax season.A well-maintained transaction record can come in handy during business audits and inspections. Regularly tracking business expenses can help you determine how you are doing financially, your business’s potential for profitability, and what needs to change. Expense tracking helps you categorize and organize all the financial data essential to keep the business running. Tracking business expenses also helps you budget effectively and find external funding if required. Note Remember to keep records of business expenses and other business paperwork even after you file your taxes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Where do I put insurance when it comes to business expense categories? Insurance payments can fall under the vehicle expense category if it's vehicle insurance, and the salaries and compensation category if you are offering insurance policies to employees. How do I write off business expenses? You can write off business expenses when filing your taxes. This can be done by filling in the relevant tax forms (i.e. Form 1040, Schedule C) and submitting the information by following the instructions on the document. The IRS provides a guide on deducting business expenses. How do I keep track of business expenses and income? Traditionally, businesses would keep track of their expenses and income by hiring an accountant or recording their transactions manually. Nowadays, however, there are several free or low-cost software programs and apps to make tracking easier and more convenient. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

{"text": "- (Photo: REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya)\nThis Thursday, the U.K.'s Prime Minister David Cameron will meet with other world leaders in London to pound out a plan for stability in Somalia.\nThe purpose behind the one-day meeting between powerful leaders and international organizations is to come up with a comprehensive solution regarding Somalia by focusing on key issues like terrorism, piracy, and humanitarian assistance.\nBut even now, as preparations for the meeting are taking place, almost one million Somalis are seeking refuge in neighboring countries because of fighting and famine conditions. New research from World Vision shows that children in Somalia are already suffering high levels of trauma as a result of the fighting, displacement and ongoing food crisis.\nThe aid organization wants to ensure solutions are sought for the refugee situation this week, and that they comply with international and national human rights and refugee laws.\nNathaniel Hurd, World Vision's policy adviser on humanitarian emergencies, told The Christian Post that it is difficult to say what, exactly, will be decided.\n\"Somalia has had challenging, complex crises for decades. Many countries are attending the conference, reflecting world concern and the impact that these crises have on Somalia's neighbors and beyond. Whenever there are so many countries involved, it can be difficult to reach agreement, although it is good to have so much interest and participation,\" he said.\nHurd told CP that World Vision hopes to see those gathered address the short and long-term needs of ordinary Somalis, call on all parties fighting in Somalia to follow international humanitarian law, and find long-term solutions for Somali refugees.\nWith the conflict likely to continue into the year, World Vision said it is concerned about Somalia's children facing further trauma living life as refugees.\nGraham Davison, Operations director for World Vision in Somalia, said in a released statement that the fighting and food crises have made large parts of the country too dangerous for children to live in. \"Until the conflict is resolved, children and families will continue to flee seeking safety in other areas of the country and across its borders,\" he said.\nKenya is currently hosting the majority of Somalia's refugees and is showing signs that it is struggling to cope. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in dangerously overcrowded refugee camps.\nDadaab, a camp in Kenya, holds more than 440,000 registered refugees despite only being set up for 90,000 – and the stress on the country's systems is leading some to call for Somalis to be returned home.\nThis is unacceptable, Davison said. \"Forcing them to return is not an option. There are reports that children in Somalia are being recruited into armed groups, and there's limited access to the vital nutrition that saves children's lives, while the school system collapsed years ago.\"\nAside from refugee camps and war, Somalis are also faced with a drought and food crisis.\nThe United Nations did announce earlier this month that it has lifted the famine designation that had applied to six regions of Somalia and was first implemented in July 2011. Heavy rains that began last fall led to one of the best harvests in more than 17 years and a surge in international aid increased the availability of food, helping to lower prices.\nHowever, the United Nations has warned that these gains are \"fragile\" and that famine conditions could return if the traditional August rains are less than expected and if political turmoil in Somalia continues to disrupt the ability of aid organizations to reach vulnerable people.\nHurd told CP that Somalia still remains one of the direst humanitarian crises in the world. The rate at which Somalis die before their fifth birthday is among the worst in the world.\nHe emphasized that in the coming year, \"millions of Somalis will continue to need help accessing clean water, food, and other things to survive. There also remains an urgent need to build peace and end the violent conflict.\""}

The first sign is the dark patches that you tend to see on a wall before it progresses to more of an issue with the black spores starting to appear. A lot of people think that a damp course will protect them but when its penetrating its actually coming through the wall. Our coatings can solve this problem for you. The coatings we use are made up with Nano technology meaning they line the pores in the sub straight rather than block them allowing the wall to breath. Because we leave a 100% waterproof finish on the outside no more moisture can get in, with the walls being able to breathe the damp that is already there is free to dry out, that's how were able to guarantee against perpetrating damp.\nRising Damp is where the damp transfers up from the ground and speads through the walls. You will possible not only see this type of damp at low levels around external walls but internal ones too. Modern builds have a damp proof membrain fitted usually about 2-3 courses of bricks up from the ground but a lot of older properties don't have one. We can inject one into the walls for you using a product called Dryzone. This is specially formulated to spread through the mortar bed before curing to form a damp-proof course. Dryzone has been approved by the BBA and can be used in walls up to 95% saturation. We offer a 20 year guarantee on all work that we carry out.\nCAVITY WALL INSULATION\nCavity Wall Insulation and the related problems. As more and more properties are having there cavities filled with blown fibber's or polystyrene balls they are now acting as a bridge for penetrating damp. The reason cavities were put in to start with was so any moisture that comes through the outer skin of brick could then run down the cavity rather than transfer into the inside of your home. When you fill them your creating a bridge so the moisture can track through to the inside wall creating damp and cold patches. Just a 5% damp content in cavity wall insulation reduces its thermal efficientcy by 50% making it worse than having it in the first place.\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY !\n\"Extremely pleased with the finished result, house looks amazing I would defiantly recommend to other people !\"\n\"Pleased with the service and attitude towards the job !

{"text": "Egypt is known for its Red Sea beaches, awesome Alexandrian seaside for long nightly promenades and most importantly, the Pyramids. We are not exactly known for a land of modern adventures, but this is quickly changing. The young people of Egypt are hip, modern and fit (well, at least most of them) and they are demanding a change in the usual vacation time traditions. The idea of sitting by the beach and reading a novel seems too mundane for those who seek the thrill of excitement. That is why sports tourism is growing.\nWe consulted one of the hip and happening Egyptian eco-tourism travel companies, Destination 31, about their take on the trend. A relatively new company, founded in 2009 by three friends, they have specialised in adventure tourism and extreme sports. “Adventure travel and sports tourism is picking up in Egypt and its popularity has been increasing significantly in the past 3 years. We do get several requests for rock climbing (which is a relatively new sport in Egypt); also, hiking & mountain trekking is becoming very popular,” said Omar Hossam, founding partner of Destination 31.\nHowever, Hossam noted that there is a lack of diversity when it comes to the touristic sports available: “In the case of Sports Tourism most of the travellers are interested more in the ones abroad due to the diversity of activities there, especially water activities, such as white water rafting, kayaking and canyoning.”\nDespite the fact that people choose to go to countries like Croatia and Slovenia for adventure travelling, Hossam said that there are some packages inside Egypt that are often demanded. “Most popular active trips in Egypt nowadays are desert safaris (in the Western Desert) due to the political instability in the Sinai Peninsula, but personally, I believe that Sinai is the most active destination in Egypt with unmatched diversity in sports and activities,” he added.\nThe company offers a lot of adrenaline-pumping trips that are worth checking out. Their main goal is to promote Egypt as the ultimate destination for tourism. In case you are wondering, the company’s name is very much related to the country, since “both the latitude and the longitude of the Nile Delta are at 31°00’00”,” Hossam explained.\nSo, here is a list of things that can be done all over the country, which is bound to get your heart pumping and the adrenaline running through your veins.\nTrekking up Mount Catherine\nLocated in the South Sinai governorate, Mount Catherine is the highest point in Egypt, at a height of 2,629 metres. The mountain is a pretty easy trek, and the only challenge is concerned with low oxygen levels and the time taken to reach the top and go back down. It really depends on how fit you are, it can take from either sunrise to sundown or just under five hours. Some of the ultra-fit people even run up and down the mountain, encouraging other slow-movers to keep their spirits up. It is best done as a group activity, especially if it’s your first time trekking up the high mountain.\nThe nicest time to trek up the mountain is November, when the weather is neither too hot nor too cold. However, if you are not afraid of the cold, nipping wind of late December and early January, you might be able to catch the snow-capped top of the mountain. From there, you can view Saudi Arabia and Jordan. It is also worth it to check out the Saint Catherine Monastery.\nTip: The last few hundred meters are stone steps, so if you have weak knees, you might want to arm yourself with some knee-support bands or climbing sticks.\nThe trend of sandboarding started five or six years ago in the wake of enormous popularity in the Gulf. Now, every local travel agency has some kind of sandboarding excursion, whether it is a one-day trip or a week-long camp; it is bound to be an adrenaline-pumping experience with some barbecuing around a bonfire. You are bound to find sandboarding-equipped locations wherever you travel in Egypt. In Aswan, the bed and breakfast hotel, Ana Kato, offers one-day trips where you take a boat from the hotel and go to a nearby dune. They can even supply food and Bedouin tea and coffee.\nThere are two places in Egypt well-known for their windy seas: North Sinai and Alexandria, and these are where the sport mostly takes place. The trend is more prominent in Ras Sedr, specifically in a small compound called Moon Beach, known for its gnarly wind and angry sea. While not preferred for swimming, since the water is less than pristine, all the windsurfing dudes and dudettes go there to get their fix. In addition, the compound and its accompanying hotel are far from luxurious, so it is not for those who are iffy. However, the compound is barely the only place available; hotels all over the Red Sea offer the sport, but you run the risk of not having enough wind to egg on your sail.\nHiking in Wadi Degla\nRight outside of Maadi is a jewel for all the thrill-seeking Cairenes out there: the Wadi Degla Protectorate. The park has survived many attempts of turning it into some awful, cement-covered facility. Essentially a valley, it offers different heights, paths and even terrains to get your hiking fix. The protectorate extends over an area of about 30 kilometres, and makes for a great and fun way to exercise. The busiest time for the valley is during the weekend when groups of people come to walk, run, or bike. Wadi Degla is also famous for its canyon, which resembles those found in Jordan or the Grand Canyon in the US. When heavy rain falls, small waterfalls form across the canyon and water gathers in small pools. Even though it makes for a great excursion, the canyon is a bit slippery on its own and so it is not advisable that you attempt to climb it during the rain. For first timers, it is best attempted in the safety of groups.\nTip: If you go to the protectorate quite early, you might be able to catch a glimpse of some of the wildlife lurking in the valley, such as red foxes, mountain rabbits and deer.\nIt is not a secret that the Red Sea is one of the best diving spots in the area, and the sport can be quite exciting. If you find looking at fish and corals boring, then you might opt for visiting the many wrecks that lie beneath the blue sea. One of the most popular ship wrecks is the Thistlegorm, which is accessible from Hurghada or Sharm El-Sheikh. The British war ship sunk in 1941 on its way to safe anchorage, when it was struck by German war aircrafts. The wreck is particularly popular due to the large amounts of cargo that can be seen while diving around. In addition, the site is known for the frequenting of Barracuda fish, sea turtles and eels.\nFor years, Egyptians have flocked to the UAE to be able to experience the sensation of jumping off a high cliff and not dying. This meant that in addition to the cost of the jump, you pay for a plane ticket and accommodation. The extreme sport is quite new to the Egyptian touristic experience. A new company called Bungy Egypt has adopted the art of flinging customers off high ramps in August. The jump location is Porto Marina in the North Coast, and the service is available from 2pm till 8pm until 15 October. They are in the process of creating a more permanent location in either Ain Sokhna or Cairo, but nothing has been announced yet. More information can be found on the company’s Facebook page, and it is a good idea to reserve a spot upfront since it might be a bit crowded over the Eid vacation.\nParasailing and water gliding\nIf you are stuck with your family on the beach and you are just aching for some kind of excitement, then it might be worth it to check out your hotel’s available activities. Most facilities around Sinai and even the North Coast offer parasailing. This is where they attach you to a parachute, which is in turn tied to a boat, and then the boat goes really fast and your are lifted to the heavens. Compared to other extreme sports, it might seem too mellow, but it is enough to get you out of the coma-inducing family holidays during the Eid vacation. Another option is the water-gliding activities, in which you sit on a floating plastic dinghy, which is either shaped like a banana or a donut. Again, the dinghy is attached to a boat and then they attempt to fling you off it several times."}
{"text": "LET ME tell you about CRETE. It’s a paradise island and the Cretans are wonderful people (well, most of them ….).\nSarah and I began our adventures in Crete in 2001 in search of the archaeology of the Bronze Age of the Minoans (c.3000-1100BC – I’ll tell you about them next time). Sarah had dragged me ‘shouting and screaming’ (maybe a slight exaggeration) into archaeology when she came home one Friday evening and, over a glass of wine or two, asked me if I wanted to learn about archaeology (she had studied it at university in the 1980s and wanted to start up again). Anyway, I said I might be and she replied, “Good, because I have booked us both into a course on ‘Practical Archaeology’ at Sussex University starting on Monday”…….. the rest, they say, is history – well, ancient history, actually.\nmyself and Sarah always smiling in Crete!\nWe have been visiting Crete almost each year ever since 2001, and in 2005 I began researching early British travellers to the island, particularly Richard Pococke (18th century cleric), Robert Pashley (19th century barrister) and, my favourite, Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt (19th century Royal Naval officer – with a great name!). My plan was to try to establish what, if anything, they may have discovered of the Bronze Age during their visits. Sarah and I spent five summers following these three guys footsteps around the island using their published journals. It was awful work, you understand ….. !! Oh, and you can read my book on my results – see Dawn of Discovery in ‘My Publications’ (or just click here).\nThen we really discovered paradise …. Mochlos. This is a small ‘fishing’ village on the north coast of the island about an hour and a half east of Heraklion and 5km off the main road. It’s no longer a fishing village as such, but, as yet, reasonably unspoiled by tourism. It also dates back to the Bronze Age Minoans when it (and its island just off its shores) was a thriving settlement. We struck it very lucky with our first accommodation, Mochlos Mare (click on name for link). This is a very picturesque set of apartments in a beautiful whitewashed building owned by an incredibly generous and lovely couple, Panayiotis and his wife, Sterie. They have this enormous garden which grows practically anything you can think of and they share everything in it with their visitors.\nMochlos from the little church on the hill – Mochlos Mare is bottom right\nWe loved the place so much that we decided to get married in Crete in 2011. We were actually married by the lake in Agios Nikolaos but went back to Mochlos on Nick’s boat to the Minoan island (top right in pic above) just off the mainland for champagne and then to Taverna Kokylia (on the mainland), for the ‘reception’. (click on name for link) – now there’s a place to reckon with. Owned by the fabulous Yiorgo (George) it is simply the best! He did us proud on our wedding day and has done so ever since on our anniversaries ……. and all the other times we have been there!\nCelebrating our wedding on Mochlos island\nNick’s boat that brought us from our wedding at Agios Nikolaos to the Mochlos island\nThen there is Dimitri’s (click on name for link), which is also a great taverna. He is a lovely chap and his food is excellent. I recall one wonderfully musical night there last year when our good friend, Warner (visiting us from UK), played his violin, whilst a young chap from Sweden played his guitar and his girlfriend sang. It just wouldn’t happen in the UK!\nIn 2012 we decided to stay the whole summer holidays in Mochlos (3 months) and came to the conclusion, sadly, that Mochlos Mare was not big enough for a stay of this length of time. We needed a bigger kitchen at least as we planned to cook-in on occasions (had to for this period of time!!). However, we found an absolutely fantastic apartment, Alexandros (click on name for link – you should be getting the idea now), just up the road from Mochlos Mare. It is owned by two lovely Australians, Peter and Rosa – Peter has Cretan connections hence his desire to buy a property on the island. Fortunately for us he and Rosa chose Mochlos!\nlooking east from balcony of Alexandros\n2013 also saw us in Mochlos (and Alexandros) for another 3 months over the summer again – and Nick’s fantastic villa was finally completed (he had bought the plot some 6 years ago!). The last time I had seen Nick and Heather (other than in Mochlos) was over 20 years ago in Wales. Then, 20 years later, I heard they had bought a plot of land in Crete – in Mochlos!! Small world or what?\nNick and I relaxing at Kokylia\nSo that’s how I found Crete.\nNext week let me introduce you to the Bronze Age Minoans of Crete.\nArtemus Smith’s Notebooks\nI continue my research of the notebooks of Dr Artemus Smith, archaeologist of great courage, determination and fiction. Here is another extract:\nI recall as a student, at my weekly tutorials at Oxford, it was a requirement to produce an essay for discussion. One week, I fear I neglected to make such an effort and I decided to ‘blag it’. On appearing before my tutor, Professor Sir Lucius Bodmin-Wallbanger, I opened my notebook and with, I have to report, some skill and imagination, pretended to read from it, turning the blank pages at appropriate intervals. Following a formidably inventive conclusion, I shut the notebook with great satisfaction, thankful that the performance had passed off smoothly, and awaited Sir Lucius’ comments.\nHe stared into the open fire for a couple of minutes, then turned to me with a congenial smile and said, “Read it again, Mr Smith.”"}
{"text": "IA SOYBEAN ASSN: HIGH CORN SEEDING RATES DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN HIGHER PROFITS\nApr. 18, 2014\nSource: Iowa Soybean Assn's On-Farm Network news release\nCorn planting will soon begin in earnest. But Iowa Soybean Association (ISA) On-Farm Network replicated strip trials show high seeding rates aren't always better.\nMore than 200 corn population trials from 2009-2013 indicate lower seeding rates are economically better than high rates the vast majority of the time, especially in dry years. Monday's U.S. Department of Agriculture Crops and Weather Report said topsoil moisture is rated 38 percent short or very short statewide, while subsoil is rated 60 percent short or very short.\nFor most corn population trials, farmers compared a difference of 5,000 seeds, or 2,500 higher and lower than the grower's typical seeding rate. For example, if the rate is usually 32,500 seeds per acre, the trial compared rates of 30,000 and 35,000 seeds per acre.\nAccording to data from On-Farm Network trials, the average yield difference between low and high rates is only 0.9 bushels per acre. And, higher seeding rates don't necessarily mean higher profits.\nTrial data can be found on the On-Farm Network's Replicated Strip Trial Database.\nUsing $5 per bushel corn and $18.75 for 5,000 seeds ($300 per bag with 80,000 seeds), the database's return on investment calculator shows high population rates did not provide a return on investment about 80 percent of the time in on-farm trials.\n\"It was surprising to me that in the majority of planting rate trials over the last five years, yield increases from the higher planting rates did not pay for the extra cost of the seed,\" said Pat Reeg, On-Farm Network director. \"Based on this research it seems the biggest potential from variable rate planting is in seed savings.\"\nThe goal of this trial, and hundreds conducted by the On-Farm Network each year, is to help farmers become more productive and profitable in a sustainable way.\nReeg said there's two questions population studies help answer: What is the ideal planting rate from a uniform seeding standpoint? Are there places in fields where it makes sense to plant with variable rate seeding?\n\"Over the last few years, many have said if we want to increase yield we have to increase population. With the price of seed, it's important that farmers verify that,\" Reeg said.\nProductivity often varies within fields for a number of reasons. Some areas have better soil and higher water holding capacity and others don't.\n\"Yield maps, aerial imagery and other precision agriculture layers are great at showing the level of variability within fields so it may make sense to vary the (planting) rate,\" Reeg said. \"However, predicting where to vary planting rates and by how much has proved challenging.\"\nBy testing two populations within the range farmers would consider planting, farmers can find out where low rates do better than high and vice versa.\n\"If you're going to build zones, shouldn't you know where you get a better return on investment?\" Reeg concluded. \"I often see zones created from soil map units that do not align well with the actual soil transitions in the field as shown below in figure 1.\nA corn planting rate trial last year in Black Hawk County is a good example, Reeg said. Strips of 28,000 and 34,000 seeds per acre were planted across the field. After emergence, nine areas were checked for uniform stand.\nThe yield varied by 115 bushels per acre between good soils with high water holding capacity compared to sandy areas. The higher planting rate outperformed the lower rate by 1.2 bushels per acre across the field.\nBut after the cost of the extra seed was factored in and corn at $5 per bushel, the high population lost about $16.50 per acre compared to the lower rate.\nThe farmer found out the low population out yielded and financially outperformed the higher population in the less productive area (12.6 acres) by about $15 per acre, while the high population in the high productive area (41.4 acres) lost about $1 per acre.\n\"There's no doubt changing population can impact yields,\" Reeg said. \"Whether it's financially good is another thing. Validating the yield difference of planting rates is an essential step in developing variable rate planting prescriptions.\"\nReeg encourages farmers looking to improve profitability to test products and management practices on their farms using replicated strip trials."}
{"text": "My parents have a pretty big garden and half of it my Dad uses as a vegetable patch. I remember picking huge gooseberries, loganberries and raspberries which were sweet enough to eat straight off the bush, watching my Mum top and tail French beans ready for the freezer and my Dad making ‘tomato paste’, from his mother’s recipe, with the excessive amounts of tomatoes that we used to end up with in a good year! It taught me not to waste food and to plan ahead when food shopping. I’m a militant list writer…\nDad phoned me the other night as he had some spare plants (two peppers and a pot of coriander!) for the cottage garden. Growing plants from seed is unpredictable, sometimes you’ll plant twenty and two come up or you’ll plant twenty and the whole lot come up! And also, that the strawberries had gone mental this year! I walked into their kitchen to pick up the plants and there were four huge bowls full of strawberries. Mum had already made about a ton of jam and the plants were still groaning with fruit. I carefully liberated two bowlfuls (half a carrier bag!) of the best looking ones!\nAfter stuffing ourselves on thick strawberry pancakes, we needed to find something to do with the rest and works with practically every fruit. Fruit leather!\nFruit, roughly chopped (Core and peel apples, take the stones out of cherries, plums, apricots, damsons, take the tops off and hull strawberries etc) Apples are good for bulking up recipes! I made up 400gr of fruit with strawberries, cherries and apples.\n1, For every 400gr of chopped fruit add 100ml of water into a large saucepan with a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice and simmer until the fruit is cooked.\n2, Mash into a smooth paste or put into a food processor and blend. Pass through a sieve if necessary to get rid of pips (especially if your using fruits like strawberries or raspberries). Add sugar if it needs sweetening up!\n3, Line a large baking tray or a big cake tin with greaseproof paper and spread the fruit thinly to about 3-5mm\n4, Pop into a preheated oven (60o/c, if possible, or the lowest setting your oven will go to) to dry out. This can take upwards of 8 hours dependant on how thickly it is spread.\n5, When it has stopped being sticky on top, peel off the paper, place onto fresh greaseproof paper. Store in an airtight container."}

{"text": "I'm looking for concrete theological beliefs and practices on where they differ. Christians say that Mormons aren't Christian and yet Mormons call themselves Christian. So it can be quite hard to tell for a everyday person who is who and what is what.\nThe \"Evangelical\" movement spreads across an incredibly wide range of beliefs, so it will be hard to nail this down, but a few things come to mind that ought to have broad acceptance and make at least some form of answer possible. For convenience in the rest of this answer, please treat the word \"Evangelical\" merely as broadly representing \"Most Evangelicals\".\nThe root question here, though, is whether or not Mormons are themselves even Christian. To understand this, you need to look at it from both sides. In a broad sense, one is a Christian when one acknowledges the person of Christ as their creator and Lord. Everything else — all the denomitions, splits, and arguments — is just details.\nWith that in mind, the Non-mormon Christian perspective is that Mormons have been lead astray, and have allowed the teachings of Joseph Smith and his successors to supersede and in many cases replace those of Christ... and so they no longer follow Christ supremely, but (perhaps unwittingly) follow Joseph Smith instead. Moreover, since Mormons refuse to grant Jesus full unity with God the Father, but hold him separate from God the Father, it is offensive to mainline Christians to watch Mormons hold up the teachings of Joseph Smith to the level of Christ, yet still use the name of Christ to describe themselves.\nThe Mormon perspective is that Joseph Smith's teachings are Christ's teachings, that Joseph Smith was merely His mouthpiece. They hold both the Old and New Testaments to be scripture (just not all scripture), and so to be considered \"not Christian\" is offensive to Mormons, because they still believe that Christ died for their sins, just as \"regluar\" Christians do.\n|show 4 more comments|\nSimply put Evangelicals differ over at least three primary things:\n1. The Nature of Jesus\nEvangelicals believe Jesus to be God - of one being with Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, etc... Mormons do not. Mormons believe Jesus to be divine, but a separate person from the Father. Evangelicals tend to subscribe to the historic creeds of the church - Nicene, Apostles, etc... - and are almost invariably Trinitarian. (I cannot say that I have ever run across a non-Trinitarian Evangelical, but as it is a movement and not a denomination, there are always exceptions).\nNote: In the comments, there was a notion that the creeds only adhered to the \"Catholic\" church. Insofar as \"catholic\" is understood as \"universal\" or \"what most people think of when they think of 'mainstream' Christianity, that is accurate. If that were taken to mean the 'Roman Catholic Church,' that would be precise, but inaccurate, in that most Protestants and Orthodox also subscribe to the Creeds and to the Trinitarian formulations thereof.\n2. The nature of the \"Bible\"\n3. The nature of soteriology\nEvangelicals, by and large, believe salvation to be solely the gift of God. We believe that all who are saved entire into eternal relationship with God. Mormons believe that people are rewarded according to the nature of the covenant they believed.\n|show 5 more comments|\nQ: practices on where they differ? These practices are different to Evangelical groups.\nAll LDS adults are also Priests, and the responsibility for their neighbors is a covenantal promise.

They are monitored by the brethren and warned if they stray from God's Will as it is defined by Scripture and by revelations of the Prophets.\nNone of the clergy is paid.

{"text": "NATO and Beyond: The “Wars of the Future”\nGlobal Research Editor’s Note\nThis incisive article, written more than ten years, describes with foresight the evolving role of NATO and the issue oof Weapons of Mass Destruction. It sheds light on the historical evolution of NATO as well as what Secretary of State Albright had described as “the Wars of The Future”, which are Todays wars. What was missing in US Foreign Policy and military doctrine in the 1990s was the “Global War on Terrorism”.\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright referred to the August 1998 missile assaults against Sudan and Afghanistan (allegedly in retaliation for the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa two weeks earlier) as “unfortunately, the war of the future.”1 In one sense, she was lamenting the likelihood of various Islamic forces retaliating against American civilian targets.\nThere is, as Albright understands, another side to these wars, more than guided missiles launched from a thousand miles away, with no danger to U.S. troops. American military strategy calls for “the use of overwhelming force to minimize United States casualties.”2 But it is not that simple. Former CIA Director Robert Gates was more precise: “[O]ur people and our Government must accept another reality: as potential official American targets are ‘hardened,’ terrorists will simply turn to non-official targets- businesses, schools, tourists and so on. We can perhaps channel the threat away from the United States Government, but not away from Americans.”3 What grand scheme, then, is in place, that may bring these “unfortunate” wars back home, against civilians?\nRecent U.S. military strategy, to implement the administration’s self-appointed role as global policeman, is now defined by its evolving unilateralism.\nThe Pathology of a Single Superpower\nWith the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the U.S. at last realized its objective to be the world’s only superpower. Though Washington-and Wall Street-had always been possessed of a rapacious ambition to control the world’s economy (what “globalization” is all about), there is now the conviction in many quarters that it is developing the military capability to do so. The acting Secretary of the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters, described the development as “learning a new kind of military operations [sic] in a new world.”4\nIt is unrealistic simply to wipe out every non-compliant government; and a few are too powerful for such a strategy. So the U.S. had devised a more comprehensive plan, and now, after some 20 years, is approaching its millennial end game.\nOne critical element has been a redefinition of the “enemy,” in order to disguise greed as a dispassionate desire to spread western “democracy.” Its complement has been the development of a military strategy for employing that definition to globalize U.S. power.\nThe New Enemy\nIt is commonplace to say that terrorism has replaced communism as the new enemy of western democracy. But this replacement has been selectively applied, geared to the goals of U.S. global hegemony. Washington’s characterization of a foreign government can change radically when little or nothing has changed in that country. The Clinton administration’s most recent pledge of more billions for defense came as the Pentagon upgraded North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, which they call “rogue” states, as no longer “distant” threats of possible nuclear missile attacks, an official position they had held only a few weeks before.5\nOf course, when this happens, it ought to raise eyebrows among the citizenry. That it doesn’t is often blamed on the average American’s notoriously short political memory, but it is really due to the remarkable ability of the media to accept new policies, new “enemies,” new “threats,” without ever acknowledging their prior, unquestioning acceptance of the old ones.6\nEnemies can become friends overnight, too. Recent events in Kosovo demonstrate how quickly and how hypocritically the U.S. government recharacterizes a situation when it suits their needs. The Kosovo Liberation Army was branded a “terrorist organization” in early 1998, but by mid-year U.S. officials, including Richard Holbrooke, were meeting with its leaders, while claiming they were not in favor of Kosovan secession and the resulting inevitability of a “Greater Albania.” Holbrooke was frank: “I think the Serbs should get out of here.”7\nThe greatest ironies in the conversion of some former anti-communist comrades-in-arms, the instant switches from friend to foe, are how some have turned religious fundamentalism into a jihad against the United States, and how, after being financed, armed, and trained by the CIA, those guns are now turned on American citizens.\nWMD and NATO\nThe government and its media spin artists have incited western fears by tarring enemy states like Iraq with the brush of “weapons of mass destruction” so repeatedly that the acronym WMD is now current jargon. Part of the “new vision” for NATO, discussed below, is to focus on WMD as a justification for millitary strikes anywhere, either as deterrence or as “preemptive retaliation.” The campaign around WMD is described as “a microcosm for the new NATO, and for its larger debates and dilemmas.”8 None of the analyses, however, point out that the U.S. is the only nation that has used all of these weapons-chemical, biological, and nuclear.\nThe U.S. has employed biological weapons for 200 years, from smallpox in the blankets of Native Americans to spreading plagues in Cuba; from chemical weapons like mustard gas to cripple and kill in World War I to Agent Orange to defoliate Vietnam-and to create a generation of deformed children. It is the only nation that has dropped nuclear bombs, and one that now makes, uses, and sells depleted uranium weapons.\nThe chemical weapons charges levied against Iraq are fraught with irony. When Iraq was at war with Iran, and the U.S. considered Iran the greater enemy (a view that changed under Israeli pressure), it was facilitating the sale of chemical weapons to Iraq.9\nThe weapons inspectors in Iraq claimed that their inventories of “unaccounted for” WMDs came from boxes of secret Iraqi documents discovered “hidden on a chicken farm near Baghdad,”10 but there were easier ways to have compiled such inventories-like reviewing the CIA’s reports of the secret arms deals it brokered in the 1980s.\nFor the U.S., the United Nations has been a double-edged sword. Because of its Security Council veto, it can frustrate actions it opposes, but cannot always force actions it wishes.\nThus the U.S. has fostered-and funded-U.N. tribunals to punish alleged war crimes in Bosnia and in Rwanda, but would never allow such extraterritorial tribunals to investigate crimes against humanity in Indonesia, for example, or in any of its other client states. For this reason, the U.S. refuses to ratify the proposed International Criminal Court and opposes the trial of Augusto Pinochet in Spain.11\nWhere geographically possible, the military planners have turned increasingly to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which Secretary Albright described as “our institution of choice.”12 NATO is not “hostage” to U.N. resolutions, one “strategic analyst” said.13 A U.S. “official” explained that the U.N. “figures in this as far as possible,” but that the new definition of NATO is meant to include the possibility of action without U.N. mandate.14\nA Times editorial warned against “transforming the alliance into a global strike force against threats to American and European interests.”15 But Secretary Albright reaffirmed that the shift is from collective defense of the NATO members’ territory to “the broader concept of the defense of our common interests.”16 This means, in practical terms, the U.S. forcing the NATO imprimatur on military interventions in the internal affairs of sovereign states that are not members of the alliance.17\nThe most obvious and illegal expansion of NATO’s mandate has been its intervention in Kosovo. As we go to press, NATO is voting whether to authorize airstrikes against the Serbian military. The rationale for the Clinton administration’s push for the bombing is described as to “do something” for the sake of “credibility,” especially because President Milosevic might “belittle the celebration marking the West’s triumph over Communism,” planned for April in Washington.18 He might otherwise, one Pentagon official feared, try to turn the celebration into a “Kosovo summit.”19\nAfter President Milosevic agreed to allow a monitoring (“verifying”) team into Kosovo, the U.S. chose career diplomat William Walker to head the mission, under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.20 Walker, when U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, oversaw and condoned some of the most brutal oppression and murder in the Western hemisphere.\nThe UNSCOM Scam\nU.S. abuse of the U.N.’s mandate became apparent in the UNSCOM Scam. For some time, United Nations Special Commission inspectors in Iraq had attempted to gain access to President Hussein’s homes and similar sites on the unlikely excuse that they could be CBW laboratories or storehouses. The media continually berated Saddam Hussein when he claimed that espionage was involved. Nonetheless, it came as a surprise to some to learn in January that U.S. spies had been operating against Iraq under cover as UNSCOM inspectors. To add insult to injury, Iraq had been forced to pay for the inspectors from its “oil for food” program income.21\nUNSCOM was always beholden to the United States. From 1991 to 1997, UNSCOM had no U.N. budget, “but existed on handouts, especially from Washington,”22 like the Hague Tribunal on Yugoslavia. He who pays the piper calls the tune.\nThe U.S. has increasingly preferred NATO to the U.N. to avoid having its militaristic adventures vetoed. But with some disagreements within NATO as well, the Pentagon has taken to acting alone, or with a compliant ally. The August attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan were examples of totally unilateral military action by the U.S. The recent bombing of Iraq, a joint U.S.-U.K. operation, was taken without consulting either the U.N. or NATO. As one reporter noted, “the global coalition arrayed against [Saddam Hussein] in the gulf war has been badly frayed. The United States and Britain are its only steadfast members.”23\nThe arrogance of such an action (compounded by the repeated failure of its rationale, the removal of Saddam Hussein, and by the UNSCOM scandal), has generated considerable anger around the world, albeit mostly by people and governments that can do little or nothing about it but voice a “growing resentment.”24\nHowever, some of that resentment has clout. Russia, China, and India have all voiced concerns, and the recent air strikes may have prompted Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov’s informal proposal for a strategic alliance between the three nations. While visiting India to discuss the initiative at the time of the attacks, he said, “We are very negative about the use of force bypassing the Security Council.”25 France and Canada also withdrew support. To the consternation of the Americans, France, has formally ended its support for the embargo on Iraq, forcing a reexamination of sanctions and the tightly restricted “oil for food” program.26\nThe “Parallel NATO”\nNotwithstanding resentment and opposition, Washington is forging ahead with complex, ambitious, and risky plans, if not to supplant, at least to rival NATO, whenever it balks at American cowboy operations. The program is already well entrenched in Eastern Europe, where the Pentagon has bilateral military programs in 13 countries. Plans to expand into the Caucasus and former Soviet Asia are in the works.27\nThe result “is an informal alliance that parallels NATO, but is more acutely reliant on its American benefactor.”28 Another consequence of this operation is that “the Pentagon is eclipsing the State Department as the most visible agent of U.S. foreign policy.”29\nFunding for some of the programs has an Orwellian flair. The U.S. European Command in Stuttgart runs a program called the Joint Contact Team Program, which was, according to the Washington Post, “initially paid for from a discretionary fund held by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To work within congressional prohibitions of training foreign troops, the visits by U.S. military experts are called ‘exchanges’ and the experts are called ‘contact teams’ rather than trainers.”30\nOne of the convenient side effects of the operation is the astonishing expansion of U.S. arms sales to the region. Eastern Europe “has become the largest recipient of U.S.-funded military equipment transfers after the Middle East.” Some Eastern Europeans are justifiably concerned about “whether the United States is fueling a regional arms race.”31\nAnother sobering aspect of the Pentagon’s preeminence is its growing collaboration with the Central Intelligence Agency. “Ever since the Persian Gulf war, when military commanders and CIA officials became convinced of the need for closer coordination between their services, planning for covert missions has been conducted jointly.”32\nThe New Balkanization\nThe western powers, having successfully re-Balkanized the Balkans, find this Nineteenth Century tactic to their liking. Indications are that there is a serious and far-flung effort underway to Balkanize Africa, redrawing its borders. Three of the largest nations on that continent, Congo, Angola, and Sudan, face violent struggles to divide their territories. In Angola and Sudan, the rebellions, supported quite actively by the U.S., have gone on for years. The move to divide the Congo, however, began only after the recent overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko, the greedy dictator whom the U.S. had installed and kept in power for more than 30 years.\nLearning from the breakups both of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia, or more to the point, having long planned for such eventualities, the U.S. recognizes that it is easier to dominate a region when the governmental units are small. Already the media parrots are taking the cue, after years of silence on the subject. A recent, perhaps prophetic, piece in the New York Times, makes the point:\nThe borders of African nations, set up arbitrarily by the Europeans who colonized the continent a century ago, are supposed to be inviolable. Yet Congo is now split in two, perhaps for good.33\nAlthough the Organization of African Unity enshrined the colonial borders in its 1963 charter, and has generally seen them respected for 35 years, the western powers now purport to blame themselves for having imposed these unnatural divisions upon the hapless Africans.34 This, of course, encourages Balkanization and eases the path to further domination.\nIn some cases, U.S. strategy is more convoluted and Machiavellian. In the Sudan, for example, it has long been evident that the U.S. wants to keep the rebels sufficiently viable to avoid defeat, but not strong enough to pose a serious threat of the government’s overthrow. “Peace,” an “official” is quoted as saying,”does not necessarily suit American interests…. ‘An unstable Sudan amounts to a stable Egypt.’”35\nPerhaps we act alone because we have to act alone. Former CIA Director Robert Gates hinted about future wars when he wrote:\nAnother unacknowledged and unpleasant reality is that a more militant approach toward terrorism would, in virtually all cases, require us to act violently and alone. No other power will join us on a crusade against terrorism.”36\nBut, the terrorists having been created, the crusade goes on.\nEllen Ray and Bill Schaap are co-founders of CovertAction Quarterly.\n1.

{"text": "Management of mucous membrane pemphigoid\n- Kim B Yancey, MD\nKim B Yancey, MD\n- Professor & Chair, Department of Dermatology\n- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas\nMucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune, subepithelial blistering and erosive disease that affects the mucosal surfaces of the mouth (gingiva, movable mucosa, tongue, and palate), eyes, nose, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, esophagus, genitals, and/or anus (picture 1A-C) [1,2]. Limited cutaneous involvement (typically localized to the head, neck, or upper trunk) also may be present. (See \"Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid\", section on 'Mucous membrane pemphigoid'.)\nMMP may cause significant morbidity due to the tissue destruction and functional limitations that result from chronic mucosal inflammation, pain, and scarring. As examples, gingival inflammation and scarring may lead to gingival recession and loss of teeth, conjunctival scarring may contribute to blindness, and laryngeal scarring may result in airway loss.\nThe treatment of MMP, particularly MMP involving the oral cavity, will be reviewed here. The management of ocular MMP (ocular cicatricial pemphigoid) and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MMP are discussed separately. (See \"Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid\" and \"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid\" and \"Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid\" and \"Management and prognosis of bullous pemphigoid\".)\nAPPROACH TO TREATMENT\nThe primary goals of the treatment of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) are to halt the progression of the disease, improve symptoms, and prevent adverse sequelae of chronic tissue inflammation and scarring [3,4]. Few high quality trials have evaluated interventions for MMP . Thus, treatment is largely guided by clinical experience and small uncontrolled studies.

{"text": "I use the build up method. What I would do is making the skull from a 2 part epoxy putty (eg Milliput, which is what I use). and then build it up with latex.\nHi, I would not use 2 part epoxy because of the weight-it's really heavy...at least not for the structure-maybe a thin layer to look like bone...BUT, I would first make the shape of the frill as a cardboard cut-out; cardboard like the heavy gray kind on the back page of a pad of paper...you know, like yellow line paper that tears off at the top. So cut out your shape-bend it a bit so it's not like a straight flat thing-it should bend back from the face area and then up a bit-then you could use some epoxy putty or better yet; some Celluclay (it's a powdered paper mache that you mix with water and wood glue)-this will stick to the cardboard great and dry with a really cool oraganic texture like bumpy bone...I used this technique for the crab monster in Sinbads 5th Voyage. Hope this helps!, best, Stan\nWhen I did a Chasmosaurus, I sculpted the head in plasticine, made a plaster mould, then cast it in foam latex. Inside, there was a profile of the skull and beak cut out of 6mm ply, with a loop of wire running around near the outside edge of the frill. Armature wire also attached the jaw piece.\nIf you aren't going to get into the moulding and casting, probably go with something similar to what Stan is saying. If you have trouble making the complex curve shape of the frill with card, you could still make up a shape in plasticine to build the shape over. I would probably start with a layer of liquid epoxy resin over the clay, with woven fibreglass cloth, to get a thin but strong shell. Then build up in putty or Celluclay over that to get the texture. Once it is set, you lift it off the plasticine.\nI used a technique similar to Stan's for a Monoclonius puppet. I drew the general shape of the frill on a piece of thin cardboard. (A old cereal box would probably suffice). I then cut the shape out with pinking shears to give the edges a serrated look. This was bent to shape and coated with a 50/50 mixture of water and white glue. While drying, I stuck on a thin piece of medical gauze on each side of the frill. After drying, I trimmed the gauze with pinking shears to match the serrated edge of the cardboard. I attached this to the model with rubber cement. After the rubber cement dried, a coat of liquid latex was applied to gauze to form skin and to further secure the frill to the neck. Here is a pic:\nStan, any chance you could post a photo of your creation ? Thanks.\nHi Steven, I don't think I can -sort of in the same boat as Ron, and the cyclops which he wants to share more pictures of...but we're under a \"NDA\" (non disclosure agreement). We can only refer you to the officially released photos from the film...The new trailer has a quick shot of the crab and cyclops battling...and from the same sequence a still shot of the crab is on the \"Sinbad the Fifth Voyage\" facebook page. When we are allowed to we'll be posting more pics and behind the scenes stuff...\nNice! Sweet Ron- I'm giggling right now!\n@ Dan - you forgot the UUUUMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm!\nIt's just not as powerful without the UUUUMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm!\nThere goes the box office, now that we've seen this detail photo there's no need to watch the whole movie!\nThat \"sandy claws\" texture looks great in a big closeup! Some really nice details there, like the sharpened edge, and the little teeth on the lower mandible (or whatever you call half a claw).\nHow would you secure the skull structure to the wire body so it will hold effectively ?"}
{"text": "The Horn of Africa crisis of 2011-2012 affected 13 million people. The main focus of the crisis was across southern Ethiopia, south-central Somalia and northern Kenya. Regional drought came on top of successive bad rains and rising inflation. It ramped up a chronic livelihoods crisis into a tipping point of potential disaster by putting extreme pressure on food prices, livestock survival, and water and food availability. Armed conflict across the region compounded chronic ecological and economic vulnerability, which escalated the crisis and limited people’s survival and recovery choices. (IASC Real-Time Evaluation of the Humanitarian Response to the Horn of Africa Drought Crisis in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya - Synthesis Report)\nAppeals & Funding\n- Djibouti Appel global 2013\n- Ethiopia Humanitarian Requirements 2013\n- Kenya Emergency Humanitarian Response Plan 2013\n- Somalia Consolidated Appeal 2013-15\nThis week, on 17 December, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will mark its 10 year anniversary. Created in 2005, CERF marked an innovative breakthrough in humanitarian funding by Member States of the UN General Assembly as a “fund for all, by all”. It raises and pools funds before the need arises, and provides fast, predictable funding to partners on the frontlines at the onset of a crisis, as well as financing critically underfunded emergencies.\n(New York/Mogadishu, 10 October 2014) The humanitarian operation in Somalia requires urgent scale-up. We are in a race against time to save lives in areas stricken by drought and conflict.\nI am extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in southern, central and north-eastern Somalia. Bakool, Bay, Gedo, Hiraan and Galgaduud have been the most affected. Families in these communities desperately need water, food and healthcare.\n(Mogadishu, 2 September 2014): I am deeply concerned by the serious deterioration in the food security situation in Somalia. The new assessment findings by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network reflect a significant decline, owing to a lethal mix of drought, surging food prices and conflict.\nMogadishu, 13 August 2014 - Good afternoon distinguished representatives of the Security Council. I am pleased to welcome you to Somalia and for this opportunity to brief you on the humanitarian situation in Somalia, on behalf of the members of the Somalia Humanitarian Country team, who are here today.\n(Genève, le 12 Juin 2014): L'ONU et ses partenaires ont lancé un plan stratégique d'intervention humanitaire d’une durée de deux ans pour répondre aux besoins de 250 000 personnes à Djibouti et les aider à se remettre sur pieds. Parmi la population ciblée, 162 500 sont des ressortissants de Djibouti, 27 500 sont des réfugiés et 60 000 sont des migrants principalement originaires de Somalie et d'Ethiopie.\n(Geneva, 12 June 2014): The UN and partners have launched a two-year humanitarian Strategic Response Plan to respond to the needs of 250,000 people in Djibouti to help them get back on their feet. Of the targeted population, 162,500 are Djibouti nationals, 27,500 are refugees and 60,000 are migrants mainly from Somalia and Ethiopia.\nThis paper explores the role of the private sector in humanitarian action in Kenya. Kenya was selected as a case study because it has a vibrant and innovative private sector, a history of severe and repeated humanitarian crises, notably drought in the country’s arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), and a track record of public–private partnerships for humanitarian action that have exploited new technologies and experimented with new models of fundraising.\nThe 2011 drought and famine affected approximately 4 million people across Somalia. As many as 260,000 people died and thousands of people were displaced within the country and across the borders. Istahil Ali Gamadid’s family was of those driven from their homes. Istahil, a mother of eight, hails from Libasagaale village in the Waqooyi-Galbeed region of Somaliland.\nRead the full story on OCHA\nThe humanitarian crisis in Somalia remains one of the largest and most complex in the world with climatic shocks, armed conflict and protracted displacement. While over 3.2 million people still require humanitarian assistance, humanitarian access remains extremely challenging.\nThe humanitarian crisis in Somalia remains one of the largest and most complex in the world with climatic shocks, armed conflict and protracted displacement. While over 3 million people still require humanitarian assistance, humanitarian access remains extremely challenging.\nStrong winds and heavy rains in Puntland leave an unknown number of people dead and thousands affected.\nOutlook for food security remains cautious in parts of Somalia due to erratic rains.\nHumanitarian air service seeks urgent funding to maintain its support to humanitarian activities.\nA recent food security alert by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) suggests below average Deyr (October- December) rainfall in Somalia, which could result in elevated food insecurity in agro-pastoral areas of Bakool, Bay and Hiraan regions of Somalia. For Hiraan in particular, which received poor (April-June) rains, the situation could be worse as the harvest was only 35 per cent of the expected production. Humanitarian agencies are preparing contingency plans to meet the anticipated need in these areas.\nAn estimated 870,000 people require urgent humanitarian assistance while an additional 2.3 million require livelihood support until the end of the year. This is the lowest number ever since famine was declared in 2011 according to a joint report by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). This reduction is attributed to successive seasons of average to above average rainfall, low food prices and sustained humanitarian response.\n1. Executive Summary\nFamine conditions were still present in parts of southern Somalia when the 2012 humanitarian appeal for Somalia was launched in December 2011. On 3 February 2012, the famine was declared over, largely due to the delivery of aid under extremely difficult conditions and the exceptional harvest at the start of the year. With carry-over funding from 2011 and continued generous support in the months following the famine, humanitarian actors were able to build on the gains.\nThe 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa left 13.3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. CERF funds have been used to address the crisis as rainfall levels diminished towards the end of 2010. More than US$128 million was allocated to drought-affected persons in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in 2011. In 2012, another $20 million, followed by $21 million in 2013, was allocated to the region – mostly through the Underfunded Emergency window. Since 2011, CERF has disbursed a total of $169.8 million to the Horn of Africa.\nThe 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa left 13.3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. CERF funds have been used to alleviate the crisis as food insecurity increased due to limited rain fall at the end of 2010. More than US$128 million was allocated to drought-affected persons in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in 2011.\nThe Somalia crisis remains one of the largest and most complex in the world. Moreover, a shortfall in funding jeopardizes efforts to build Somalis‟ resilience to shocks.\nNairobi (19 July 2013) The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) for Somalia, Philippe Lazzarini, has expressed his appreciation to the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for allocating Somalia US$20 million for underfunded emergencies to support vital humanitarian aid for one year. Somalia was allocated the highest funding out of a total $72 million apportioned to 12 countries categorized as neglected crises around the world."}

We have inactivated the gene encoding the Fbp β-Trcp1 in mice. β-Trcp1−/− males show reduced fertility correlating with an accumulation of methaphase I spermatocytes. β-Trcp1−/− MEFs display a lengthened mitosis, centrosome overduplication, multipolar metaphase spindles, and misaligned chromosomes. Furthermore, cyclin A, cyclin B, and Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex, are stabilized in mitotic β-Trcp1−/− MEFs. Indeed, we demonstrate that Emi1 is a bona fide substrate of β-Trcp1. In contrast, stabilization of β-catenin and IκBα, two previously reported β-Trcp1 substrates, does not occur in the absence of β-Trcp1 and instead requires the additional silencing of β-Trcp2 by siRNA. Thus, β-Trcp1 regulates the timely order of meiotic and mitotic events.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (822 kb)\n- Leishmania donovani Targets Dicer1 to Downregulate miR-122, Lower Serum Cholesterol, and Facilitate ...\nCell Host & Microbe, Volume 13, Issue 3, 13 March 2013, Pages 277-288\nJune Ghosh, Mainak Bose, Syamal Roy and Suvendra N. Bhattacharyya\nSummaryLeishmania donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL) where the parasite infects and resides inside liver and spleen tissue macrophages. Given the abnormal lipid profile observed in VL patients, we examined the status of serum lipids in an experimental murine model of VL. The murine VL liver displayed altered expression of lipid metabolic genes, many of which are direct or indirect targets of the liver-specific microRNA-122. Concomitant reduction of miR-122 expression was observed in VL liver. High serum cholesterol caused resistance to L. donovani infection, while downregulation of miR-122 is coupled with low serum cholesterol in VL mice. Exosomes secreted by the infective parasites caused reduction in miR-122 activity in hepatic cells. Leishmania surface glycoprotein gp63, a Zn-metalloprotease, targets pre-miRNA processor Dicer1 to prevent miRNP formation in L. donovani-interacting hepatic cells. Conversely, restoration of miR-122 or Dicer1 levels in VL mouse liver increased serum cholesterol and reduced liver parasite burden.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (1588 kb)\nCopyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53706, USA\n- miRNAs are largely known to base pair with the 3′UTR of target mRNAs, downregulating their stability and translation. mRNA of βTrCP1 ubiquitin ligase is very unstable, but unlike the majority of mRNAs where 3′UTR determines the rate of mRNA turnover, βTrCP1 mRNA contains cis-acting destabilizing elements within its coding region. Here we show that degradation of mRNA of βTrCP1 is miRNA dependent and identify miR-183 as a microRNA that interacts with the coding region of βTrCP1 mRNA. Argonaute2 interacts with the same region of βTrCP1 mRNA in an miR-183-dependent manner. Inhibition of miR-183 function or disruption of the miR-183-binding site stabilizes βTrCP1 mRNA and elevates βTrCP1 levels, resulting in activation of the SCFβTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. We previously showed that the RNA-binding protein CRD-BP binds to the coding region of βTrCP1 mRNA and stabilizes it. Here we demonstrate that CRD-BP prevents degradation of βTrCP1 mRNA by attenuating its miR-183-dependent interaction with Ago2."}

{"text": "Lack of education support is ‘huge barrier’ for refugees resettling in Britain\nThe government must improve the support it offers to resettled refugees trying to find a job in Britain, according to a group of resettlement experts from the University of Sussex.\nIn the first longitudinal study of its kind, academics, who researched the experiences of 280 refugees who resettled in Britain as part of the Government’s Gateway Protection Programme five years ago, claim the system needs to provide better fast-track learning opportunities and mentoring schemes to help resettled refugees to find work.\nThe three-year research programme, which was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), involved refugees from Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Iraq who were resettled in Brighton and Hove, Norwich, Manchester and Sheffield.\nThe University of Sussex experts found that the current system does not meet the diversity of refugees coming to resettle in Britain - as a result they are calling for the following changes to be made to the system:\n• Refugees with higher levels of education need fast-track learning routes which support them in finding employment which reflects their previous work and qualifications.\n• Overseas qualifications are often not recognised in the UK - pathways through the education system such as vocational training and ways of ‘topping up’ qualifications need to be put in place to support people.\n• If you don’t have UK qualifications or UK work experience it is very difficult to convince an employer to hire you - research highlights the need for buddying schemes, work shadowing and mentoring to prove you can do a job.\nThe government’s Gateway Protection Programme resettles up to 750 refugees a year in small groups (between 60 – 100 people) based on nationality. Last year the former Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 – the academics are now calling on the current Prime Minister Theresa May to ensure the system reflects the diversity of refugees in order for them to have optimum chance to reach their full potential.\nDr Linda Morrice, who worked on the research project, said: “Refugees who are starting a new life in Britain want to work and see this as a key pathway to integrating. This government needs to improve the current resettlement system in order to ensure refugees resettling in Britain now, like those from Syria, have the best opportunity and support to gain employment which meet their skills.\n“We must shift the focus from talking about ‘meeting numbers and targets’ to ensuring that we have fast-track learning routes in place, especially English language learning. For people with higher-level qualifications we need tailored support to help refugees to gain qualifications and find work.”\nYared, a former high court judge in Ethiopia, who resettled in the UK 10 years ago as part of the government’s scheme, struggled to get a job when he arrived and is a now a traffic warden in Brighton. He dreams of being a human rights lawyer but works as a traffic warden because, he says: “Without a job you are living as a beggar.”\nFor more information about the “Optimising refugee resettlement in the UK: A comparative analysis” project please visit here."}

Cohen’s mathematical model of how the disease spreads has had public health implications for millions of poor Latin Americans.\n“The network of infectious disease is incredibly dynamic,” Cohen says.\nBecause most species rely on other species for their energy, or are consumed by other species in search of energy, the species are all interconnected, forming a network known as the food web.\nCohen himself has kept logs of the species of food he eats, and over time it comes to about 150 different species of plants and animals. Humans collectively consume tens of thousands of other species. “That represents a lot of energy, and a lot of diversity, coming in,” he says.\nCohen's life work is to figure out the dynamics and interactions between the 100 million or so interconnected species on this planet.\nThe broad reach of his research has earned Cohen not only entrance into expected societies, such as the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, but also onto the worldwide Board of Governors of The Nature Conservancy.\nCohen is Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor at Rockefeller University and Professor of Populations at the Earth Institute at Columbia University.\nIn 2002, New York Mayor Michael R.

{"text": "Why Are Image to Text Software So Beneficial?\nIf you have ever tried copying the text in an image, then you know that that job is a lot easier said than done. But if it must be done, you should not worry too much about it because there are actually image to text software that you can use. Even better news is that you will be able to receive a number of wonderful benefits from this great software. Before you get this great software, you might first want to understand some of the greatest benefits that it will surely offer you. Here, you will learn about the best benefits that image to text software can provide for you. So out of all the great benefits that you will receive, here are only the top 3 benefits.\nConvenience of it all; this is the first great benefit that image to text software will offer you. One thing is sure when you manually write or type everything in an image down, and that is that you will face great inconveniences. If you are always on a tight schedule, then these inconveniences will grow even more. Because image to text software does the task of writing everything down, you can be sure that your inconveniences will turn into conveniences. So this is benefit number one that you will receive from image to text software.\nGreat speed of the whole process; this is the second great benefit to image to text software. If you do this task manually, then you probably know that it will take a really long time before you can get it done. If you need it finished right away, then that might not happen. You can expect the image to be written down immediately when you let image and text software do the job for you; you can be sure that the task will be done right away. So this is the second great benefit that image to text software can provide for you.\nYet another thing, image to text software can provide great ease of use. There are a lot of people that avoid this great software because they think that it will be too complicated for them. You can be sure, though, that it is not hard to learn at all; in fact, it is very user friendly, thus allowing anyone to be able to learn it and use it. Because of its user friendliness, then you can be sure that you won’t have a problem with it at all. So this is benefit number three that you will receive from image to text software; however, just because this was the last benefit that we mentioned here in no way means it is the least of the benefits."}
{"text": "March 11, 2013 -- Research has long linked high socioeconomic status with better health and lower mortality. But what's remained unclear is whether this association has more to do with access to resources (education, wealth, career opportunity, etc.) or the glow of high social status relative to others. Scholars call the latter \"relative deprivation.\"\nTo tease apart these factors, a team of investigators at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health led by Dr. Bruce Link, studied Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, Emmy Award winners, and former Presidents and Vice Presidents, comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition or election. The result: There were no consistent advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent, though the specifics are revealing. Overall, the results suggest that access to resources and opportunity is more important than relative status.\nFindings are published online in the American Sociological Review.\nDr. Link and his associates found the following effects of winning vs. losing in the three groups:\n\"The relative deprivation theory would predict that losers would consistently be at a disadvantage for health and longevity compared to winners, but this is not what we see,\" says Dr. Link, a professor of Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School.\nA more likely explanation, he notes, is that the advantages and disadvantages of winning depend on the mix of opportunities and stresses that they bring. Winning an Emmy often leads to significant career opportunities that might not have been otherwise available. (The paper quotes actor John Larroquette saying \"There's no doubt that having an Emmy preceeds you through the door.\") On the other hand, Baseball Hall of Fame induction occurs after playing careers are over and therefore has little bearing on career opportunities and earnings.\nAs for presidential and vice presidential candidates, life circumstances do change for members of this elite club, but winning also brings significant risks: assassination threats and extreme stress from two of the world's most demanding jobs. The 15 men who led our country during the 20th century but died by the year 2008 lived an average of 1.9 years less than the average American male of the same age.\n\"Our findings provide an important correction to an overemphasis on relative deprivation as an explanation of health inequalities,\" said Dr. Link. \"Relative deprivation likely plays some role in health inequalities, but it is not as important as the life circumstances and opportunities that result from one's socioeconomic position.\""}

{"text": "A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors—the transformer's coils. A varying current in the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) or \"voltage\" in the secondary winding. This effect is called mutual induction.\nIf a load is connected to the secondary, an electric current will flow in the secondary winding and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit through the transformer to the load. In an ideal transformer, the induced voltage in the secondary winding (Vs) is in proportion to the primary voltage (Vp), and is given by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary (Ns) to the number of turns in the primary (Np).\nBy appropriate selection of the ratio of turns, a transformer thus allows an alternating current (AC) voltage to be \"stepped up\" by making Ns greater than Np, or \"stepped down\" by making Ns less than Np.\nIn the vast majority of transformers, the windings are coils wound around a ferromagnetic core, air-core transformers being a notable exception.\nTransformers range in size from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage microphone to huge units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect portions of power grids. All operate with the same basic principles, although the range of designs is wide. While new technologies have eliminated the need for transformers in some electronic circuits, transformers are still found in nearly all electronic devices designed for household (\"mains\") voltage.\nProject: Construct a step-down transformer\nOutput: 0 – 15V"}

LOUIS, MO and SAN DIEGO, CA, March 15, 2022 – Wugen, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf cell therapies to treat a broad range of hematological and solid tumor malignancies, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1/2 trial of WU-CART-007 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). WU-CART-007 is an off-the-shelf, fratricide-resistant CD7-targeted CAR-T cell therapy engineered to overcome the technological challenges of harnessing CAR-T cells to treat CD7+ hematological malignancies. Additionally, Wugen announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to WU-CART-007 for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n“The dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1/2 trial for R/R T-ALL/LBL is a significant milestone as we continue to advance the first, off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy for T-Cell malignancies in the United States into the clinic,” said Dan Kemp, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Wugen. “We are also pleased to have received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for WU-CART-007, which further augments our efforts to deliver this therapy to patients in an area of great unmet need.”\n“Globally, about 11,000 patients are diagnosed with T-ALL/LBL every year. About half of these patients are either resistant to frontline therapy or relapse even after initial remission, and are ultimately left with very limited treatment options,” added Dr. Armin Ghobadi, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, and principal investigator of the site at the Washington University School of Medicine. “Nelarabine is the only FDA approved therapy for R/R T-ALL, and for more than a decade, no other advances have been made for this patient population. We look forward to advancing WU-CART-007, which has the potential to transform the care paradigm for these patients.”\nThe Phase 1/2 trial is a first-in-human, multi-site, global, open-label study of WU-CART-007 to evaluate its safety and clinical efficacy in patients with R/R T-ALL/LBL. Phase 1 of the study is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of a single dose of WU-CART-007 following lymphodepleting conditioning therapy and to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), cellular kinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 of the study will investigate preliminary anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Additional information is available on clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT# 04984356.\nThe FDA Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan designation for novel drugs or biologics being developed to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. ODD qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including potentially a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity, tax credits for clinical research costs, clinical research trial design assistance, the ability to apply for annual grant funding and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fees.\nWU-CART-007 is an off-the-shelf, fratricide-resistant CD7-targeted CAR-T cell therapy engineered to overcome the technological challenges of harnessing CAR-T cells to treat CD7+ hematological malignancies. Wugen is deploying CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to delete CD7 and the T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC), preventing CAR-T cell fratricide and mitigating the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). WU-CART-007 is manufactured using healthy donor-derived T-cells to eliminate the risk of malignant cell contamination historically observed in the autologous CAR-T setting. WU-CART-007 is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). Additional information is available on clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT# 04984356.\nWugen, Inc., is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf memory natural killer (NK) and CAR-T cell therapies to treat a broad range of hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Memory NK cells are hyper-functional, long-lasting immune cells that have evolved to attack cancer and respond to infection. Wugen is harnessing the power of this rare cell population by using its proprietary technologies to create WU-NK-101, currently in development for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and solid tumors. Wugen is also advancing WU-CART-007, an allogeneic CAR-T currently in development for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).

The official name of the waterway is the Welland River.\nPrior to 1829 this river flowed into the Niagara River (west to east) but when the first Welland Canal was built in the late 1820’s the flow of water was reversed by dredging a treacherous sandbar at the mouth of the river where it met the Niagara River. The water now flows from the Niagara River into the Welland River (east to west). This allowed ships travelling down the Niagara River from Buffalo to travel down the Welland River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario to the new canal by-passing the falls.\nHere are a few recent photos I took of the Chippawa Creek at dusk.

{"text": "I woke up this morning to the news the California State Senate failed to pass a ban on plastic bags, really sad news and a disgusting example of our government for sale. The havoc these bags cause to our oceans and waterways is devastating to fish, wildlife and ultimately us. Toxins such as Phthalates, that leach from the plastic, as well as pollutants that adhere themselves to the macro plastic particles, get into the food chain as more and more of the fish we eat mistake these macro particles for their food.\nA lot of people are aware of the problems with plastic bags, but many may not know that another culprit is a benignly named little bugger called the nurdle. Nurdles are pre-production plastic pellets and resin materials typically under 5mm in diameter, that are used in the production and manufacturing of thousands of the products we use. Over 250 billion pounds of nurdles are shipped each year, and many, many of them fall off of railroad cars and ships, and then find their way to our oceans and beaches.\nIt is estimated that about 10% of the litter found on beaches worldwide are nurdles. I roamed a beach in Seal Beach, just south of Long Beach, to find hundreds of them lying around the beach, I can tell you the story is the same on most any other beach you might find yourself beach-combing on. Nurdles are just part of the family of plastic trash that is caught in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the North Pacific Gyre that wash up on our beaches and get ingested by birds and fish. Atolls in the Hawaiian archipelago like Kure and Midway are littered with plastic debris and the carcasses of albatrosses that migrate there and eat the plastic particles, and either suffocate or starve to death. The graphic example of what was found inside the belly of an albatross is courtesy of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, an organization that is doing extraordinary work in the areas of research and education concerning plastic in our oceans.\nThere is no easy way to wrap this up I’m afraid, passage of the plastic bag ban would have been a good start. This leaves it up to local cities and towns to institute bans, which has already started to happen in towns like San Francisco and Palo Alto, with other cities like Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach soon to follow. As long as the chemistry and petroleum industry has millions of dollars to spend swaying the votes of our legislators, it will be a long hard fought battle each time."}

For example, in Cameroon – one of the most ecologically diverse countries in Africa – intensive logging threatens the country’s tropical rainforests and the habitat of over 40 species of wildlife, including gorillas, elephants and the black rhinoceros, with extinction (Friends of the Earth 1999). According to research in the late 1990s, the number of logging enterprises increased from 194 to 351 in 1995, following the devaluation of the local currency in 1994. Timber exports grew by 49.6 per cent between 1995- 96 and 1996-97 (Friends of the Earth 1999).\nThe oil industry is another high-profile issue in which interlinkages between the environment and social and economic development are important. The benefits and costs associated with the industry are often contested. Although the oil industry has been linked to high levels of growth through increasing national income and employment, it can also be a cost on the environment, impacting negatively on coastal and marine environments and tourism, leading to long-term loss of jobs and thus slowing economic growth. In the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, SSA’s largest oil producer, oil extraction has caused severe environmental degradation due to oil spills and lax environmental regulations (Energy Information Administration 2003). Inadequate investment, social and governance policies have meant that growth has not benefited poor people. For many, oil refineries, wells and transportation activities are opportunities to increase and diversify trade relationships with other nations and to participate in the global economy. There is often controversy around oil extraction activities. For example, the US$3 700 million Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, which was approved by the World Bank in June 2000, has been the target of protests from environmental and human rights groups. They argue that the project would dislocate inhabitants along the pipeline route and harm wildlife in the rainforests through which the pipeline would pass. Oil pollution is a major issue in Africa with the chronic release of oil in ports through ship leakage, ship maintenance or mishandling (Energy Information Administration 2003). According to the US Energy Information Administration, the problem of oil discharge in ports is often ignored, even though cumulatively the oil may negatively impact the surrounding ecosystem, including seabeds, wetlands and mudlands, which are environmental resources of economic significance (Energy Information Administration 2003).\nVarious tools and policy-making processes seek to address the complex human-environment nexus and use interlinkages to do so. These include integrative assessment processes (discussed in Chapter 9: Genetically Modified Crops) and inclusive policy processes (discussed in Chapter 1: The Human Dimension and Chapter 9: Genetically Modified Crops). Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are important tools which employ an integrated and interlinked approach to evaluating relative costs and benefits in diverse spheres – demonstrating the interlinkages between environmental, social and economic issues – and creating opportunities for deciding on appropriate development opportunities. They seek to produce early and adequate information about the likely environmental consequences of certain plans and projects, to propose alternatives and to establish measures to mitigate harm. Additionally, EIAs potentially bring a multiplicity of government agencies and institutions, organizations, experts and members of the public into the decision-making process. The need for an interlinkages approach is further demonstrated in Box 12, which considers the loss of energy in the oil production process that could be used to produce electricity. This lost opportunity is the result of a poorly developed natural gas industry. An interlinkages approach, such as through an EIA, would have helped identify these costs and benefits at an early stage and is, therefore, fundamental to identifying opportunities for development.\nNational oil industry practices, such as those raised above, may have a bearing on the implementation of several policy instruments, including MEAs such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), global targets such as the MDGs, and regional plans and programmes such as the NEPADEAP, as well as African regional conventions. Box 12 shows that local activities have impacts that may be felt at different scales. Thus, in developing responses to situations like that described in Box 12, it is crucial that the link to global and regional policy instruments be made. Additionally, for Africa to benefit from the oil industry and simultaneously avoid environmental impacts of global significance, capacity needs to be improved. This can be addressed by the global community making good its pledge at the WSSD to invest in industry and sustainable production methods.\nEnvironmental impact assessment tools are more useful in understanding the complexity of the issues at stake than traditional cost-benefit analysis, which sets out to add up in monetary terms the benefits of a public policy and compare them to the costs. There are major challenges in cost-benefit analysis. More often than not it involves comparing aspects that are fundamentally different and whose range of values cannot be reduced to purely monetary terms. The environment has both use and non-use values. (see Chapter 1: The Human Dimension for a discussion of the diverse values of environmental resources). Non-use values are particularly hard to quantify in monetary terms. Costbenefit analysis cannot overcome its fatal flaw: it is completely reliant on the impossible attempt to price the priceless values of life, health, nature and the future (Heinzerling and Ackerman 2002).\nDespite the value of EIAs as a decision-making tool, the region faces various challenges in fully implementing this approach, particularly the lack of capacity in human, financial and technical areas. Box 13 looks at how IUCN – the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the governments in Eastern Africa are working together to enhance EIA capacity."}
{"text": "History in the making: Perseverance, preservation, and preserves\nBefore the 99 percent, there was the 50 percent. Protesters chanted and blew whistles outside the Whitney Museum, and painted “50% “on raw eggs surreptitiously left inside the galleries. The cause? Women artists’ under-representation in the Whitney’s annual exhibition.\nThe year was 1970, and alongside anti-war and black power demonstrations, the nascent feminist art movement was attempting to shake up the male-dominated art world. Artist Lynn Hershman-Leeson began filming fellow activists— an endeavor she continued for the next 40 years, resulting in the film, !Women Art Revolution, which screens on Saturday at 12:45pm during the Virginia Film Festival, one of several festival documentaries about the impact of art making.\nAlthough uneven, !Women Art Revolution offers a fascinating combination of interviews, newsreel footage, and images of artwork by women who should be household names but aren’t: Howardena Pindell, Martha Rosler, Ana Mendieta, etc. Particularly noteworthy are Hershman-Leeson’s interviews with the same women artists at different points in their careers (sometimes 10 years apart), as they reflect on their activism and its influence on their work.\nThe film is a testament to the power of political art. Today it’s hard to believe, but when Judy Chicago’s “The Dinner Party” premiered in 1979, it sent male Congress members into apoplectic outrage over its celebration of female genitalia. A must-see despite its flaws, !Women Art Revolution illuminates a little-known and important chapter of recent art history. A panel discussion with Carmenita Higginbotham and Jennifer Hoyt Tidwell, among others, follows the Saturday screening.\nCongress appears in a better light in These Amazing Shadows, which provides an overview of the National Film Registry, established in 1988 to counter Ted Turner’s colorization of black-and-white classics. Screening on Thursday at 7:45pm, the documentary goes inside the government’s film preservation facility in Culpeper and explains how and why films are selected for the Registry. It persuasively argues that film is an art form that provides unique historical insights, but the project strays in interviewing film insiders about favorite movies. Also, the sweeping score recalls those irritating “Oscar Night” orchestral interludes.\nA different kind of film about “making,” El Bulli, which screens on Sunday at 6:45pm, reveals the intense research and testing behind the culinary artworks created by Spain’s famed but now closed El Bulli restaurant. The camerawork is raw, but the Zen-like pace is seductive.\nAlthough not art films per se, these three films document different impacts of art making.\nThese Amazing Shadows screens at 7:45, November 3, at Regal 3 on the Downtown Mall, !Women Art Revolution screens at 12:45pm, November 5, at Regal 3; and El Bulli screens at 6:45pm, November 6, at Vinegar Hill Theatre.

{"text": "A Review of Christian Wiman’s He Held Radical Light\nThe poet Seamus Heaney paused in the middle of dinner and leaned over to make a confession to Christian Wiman, who was, at the time, the editor of Poetry magazine. Knowing Wiman to be a Christian not only in name, Heaney admitted that he “felt caught between the old forms of faith that he had grown up with in Northern Ireland and some new dispensation that had not yet emerged. That was trying to emerge.” (88-9)\nWiman still wonders at his response to the confession:\nWhat might I have said? All you have to do, Seamus, is open your big Irish heart to Jesus. One more truth that dies with the utterance. No, the casual way that American Christians have of talking about God is not simply dispiriting, but is, for some sensibilities, actively destructive. There are times when silence is not only the highest, but the only possible, piety. (94)\nAnd so silence is what he offered the poet.\nI grew up in the tension that Wiman talks about here. As a Methodist child I remember a lay witness mission where penal substitutionary atonement and the Sinner’s Prayer were wielded like hammers on the nails of our hardened hearts…as if this were the only language necessary to get us to the desired end. And how often since have I been in services and programs where I begged for other words, ANY other words, to get at the hunger and desire I felt in my soul! Begged because I also knew, from Methodist preachers newly minted by 70s-era seminaries and the neo-Hippies of the Jesus Movement that there was so much more to feel and say.\nChristian Wiman has crafted a testimony to that hunger in his exquisite new book, He Held Radical Light: The Art of Faith, The Faith of Art. The title comes from a poem by A.R. Ammons, whom Wiman heard at a “disastrous reading” when Wiman was “a virgin of poetry readings” and an undergrad at Washington & Lee. In that reading, Ammons labored for a scant ten minutes before stating to the audience, “You can’t possibly be enjoying this,” and returned to his seat. After some cajoling he returned to the podium only to give up again some minutes later. “‘Enough,’ he muttered finally, and thudded his colossal body down beside his wife like the death of faith itself.” (6)\nBut this episode at the beginning of Wiman’s book is not really the death of faith at all but the beginning of a lively engagement with poets like Mary Oliver and Mary Karr, A.E. Stallings and C.K. Williams, most of whom find their faith in fleeting moments. “Glimmerings,” Heaney calls them, and they “are what the soul’s composed of” (89). And far from lamenting that these artists aren’t singing a full-throated rendition of a pale Chris Tomlin song, Wiman celebrates their obscure journeys and graspings after deeper encounter. He quotes Abraham Heschel’s definition to bolster this spiritual expedition. Faith is, Heschel said, “primarily faithfulness to a time when we had faith.” (34)\nWiman’s book is many things: a dialogue with poets and poems, a meditation on art and its ends, a survivor’s guide to mortality and death. (Wiman has lived with life-threatening cancer in recent years.) But his thoughts on calling and vocation are most appealing to me at this stage in my life. Thirty years after my ordination, the stories and quotes I have often used to share my ‘call story’ have ossified into markers pointing back to a time when I thought following God was about a clarity and surety I didn’t have. Annie Dillard’s weasel, in her story “Living Like a Weasel,” going for the eagle’s jugular and locking into that fixed point of life was (and is) thrilling.\nBut Wiman celebrates the caution and provisionality of speaking about things like love and truth and God. And he recognizes that, however much we would yield to a call, there is a danger in claiming it too fiercely:\nIt’s almost the definition of a calling that there is strong inner resistance to it. The resistance is not practical—how will I make money, can I live with the straitened circumstances, etc.—but existential: Can I navigate this strong current, and can I remain myself within it? Reluctant writers, reluctant ministers, reluctant teachers—these are the ones whose lives and works can be examples. Nothing kills credibility like excessive enthusiasm. Nothing poisons truth so quickly as an assurance that one has found it. “The impeded stream is the one that sings.” (Wendall Berry) (10)\nNot everyone will get this. Part of us will always go marching with the flaming zealot whose single-minded devotion makes an easy Guideposts devotional. But for some the way of the artist will sing more deeply than an earnest praise band. “What I know is that poetry is not enough,” Wiman says, “Yet it’s not that simple. For the paradox—the vital, fatal fact at the heart of human existence—is that with art, as with every truly creative act in life, you must act as if the act itself is enough.” (112)\nIf that fidelity to art’s long journey toward, if not to, God appeals to you, this book will soothe your soul. Even as it will definitely quicken your hunger."}

Every brewery appreciates as a desired objective the need and the challenge to increase its output while reducing overall energy consumed. Justification of investments resulting in reduced energy or GHG footprint in the brewery can be difficult for the artisanal brewery, which does not have scale in its favor. Examples will be presented across all areas of the brewery, with data on projected payback and potential savings that can be realized. Some solutions are scalable across three orders of magnitude, and some are applicable to only one scale. Notable brewers have committed to approaches beyond the constraints defined by ROI due to company philosophies in anticipation that their customers will endorse such commitments, and data addressing this framework will be shared. Every brewery must find its balance in how it can reduce its energy footprint, and there is a place for emerging technologies and approaches, as well as in proven and established investments. The engineer’s perspective presented must be reconciled with brewing and quality philosophies.\nJaime Jurado has served as director of brewing operations for more than 14 years at The Gambrinus Company Breweries. His focus includes engineered approaches to growth, such as modeling and resolving optimal tank sizes at one brewery, upgrading and improving energy yield in another, reducing the GHG footprint by design in another. Jaime is a senior member of the AIChE, a past chair of the San Antonio ACS Section, program chair of CERMACS ACS conferences, and past president of MBAA.

{"text": "Automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, are the only product that can stop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) from becoming sudden cardiac death. AEDs were designed to be easily placed in public gathering places, and as such, are smaller and more portable than their counterparts in hospitals. Because of this, and because they may be needed in an area where there is no electric outlet, AEDs\nare powered by batteries. It can be said that AED batteries are one of the most important components of an AED unit; without a battery, the AED will not work.\nAED Battery By Brand\nAED Brands carries replacement batteries for the following AED devices:\n- Philips Onsite, FRx, Hearstart FR2 and Forerunner AEDs\n- Defibtech Long-Life, Standard and View AEDs\n- Cardiac Science Powerheart, G3, G3 Pro, Survivalink FirstSave and Firstsave AEDs\n- Heartsine Samaritan AED\n- Physio Control (formerly Medtronic) LIFEPAK 500, 1000, 12 (SLA, NiCD and Li-ion)), 15, LP 20e and CR Plus AEDs\n- Zoll AED Plus, Pro, Pro Smart and Pro SurePower\nEnsure Your AED Battery Is Charged\nAn AED battery can come in two forms – rechargeable and non-rechargeable. AED Brands carries both types of defibrillator batteries, as well as battery chargers. An important part of any AED program is ensuring that your AED battery is charged and in working order; it can be a matter of life and death.\nThis became all too clear on Saturday, June 25, 2011, when a member of the Balance Gym in Washington, DC collapsed and died. A witness to the tragedy said that during the resuscitation attempt, it was discovered that the AED’s batteries were dead and had been removed from the unit. Pete Piringer, the DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department spokesperson, said, “It is critical the [AED] batteries and pads\nare checked on a regular basis. Your pads may be one or two years old and possibly even expired.”\nTest Your AED Battery\nHe also said that automated external defibrillators are useless if they are not maintained properly. This includes having a regularly scheduled AED battery test, to make sure the battery is fully charged and ready for use. It is unclear whether the victim would have survived even if the AED batteries had been working; however, no one will ever know.\nAll fifty states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of legislation to encourage businesses, such as health clubs, schools, golf courses and other public gathering places like airports and convention centers, to provide AEDs on their premises. However, the District of Columbia does not require private health clubs to have working AEDs onsite.\nSCA is an urgent medical emergency, because the time from the victim’s collapse to the time of brain damage or death can be as short as five minutes. Most SCA victims do not survive if not treated by an AED in less than ten minutes.\nStudies estimate that nearly 400,000 Americans suffer sudden cardiac arrest each year. This number includes all ages, from infants to the elderly. To help save these victims, AEDs and working AED batteries are needed where people gather; they need to be regularly maintained and checked to ensure that if and when an SCA emergency happens, the AED battery will be ready to power the AED and hopefully restart the victim’s heart."}

{"text": "A panel of three federal judges on Monday granted Gov. Jerry Brown's request for two more years to reduce the population of California's severely overcrowded prisons. The extension wasn't given for good behavior.\nThe state's record on prison overcrowding is abysmal. California probably didn't deserve what amounts to a political victory for Brown. The governor is banking that his new plan to reduce recidivism will work. It better, given that the judges are adding an officer with the power to take action if the state doesn't follow the court order.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld an earlier federal court ruling declaring that conditions in state prisons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The courts repeatedly have ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 percent of capacity, but California still is about 5,000 inmates over that limit.\nBrown was facing an April deadline before the delay. The governor argued that the only way he could comply would be to release thousands of dangerous inmates or spend $70 million to house them in out-of-state facilities. In an election year, there is simply no way Brown was going to release any high-risk inmates, especially since California's 65 percent recidivism rate is the highest in the nation. And spending money just to move prisoners around is not a long-term strategy for success.\nThe judges' ruling means the governor instead can spend about $80 million on rehabilitation programs designed to help inmates find legitimate employment and break the vicious repeat offender cycle.\nA better approach would be to adopt Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg's more ambitious plan to give counties additional funding to expand mental health and drug programs for criminal offenders in county jails and state prisons. Steinberg believes the money will be well spent if it keeps inmates from becoming repeat offenders.\nThe state also needs to take a look at the sentencing laws that created this problem, beyond the three-strikes law voters weakened last year. California can't continue to impose such long sentences unless residents are willing to spend the money it takes to house its prisoners.\nBrown and the Legislature have until February 2016 to reduce the state's recidivism rate and establish more reasonable sentencing laws. That is plenty of time to impose real reforms that ensure the state meets the minimum requirements for the health and safety of its prisoners."}

{"text": "I was sitting down having coffee last week with a friend whom I admire for so many reasons I could never count them all. She is incredibly bright, talented, insightful and sincere to name a few. On this particular day, it was her insight that had my attention.\nShe was telling me a story of how she was weeding her garden a few days before; down on her knees, hand weeding her carrots all the way down one long row. She was sitting back on her heels with a sense of accomplishment, so sure of the quality of job she had completed. She looked back at her work, astonished.\nFrom her “far end of the row” vantage point she saw all the weeds she had missed on her diligent journey down the row of carrots. She was taken aback! How, when she had been so careful to nip away even the tiniest of weedling she found, had she missed so many weeds? It was as if they materialized after she passed by. Perspective is everything!\nOftentimes, I think my first gift to my clients is in the ability to help them look at their lives differently. Earlier this week, I worked with a woman who had lost her Dad as a relatively young woman. Her Dad came through lovingly and talked to her about how her grief was tied up in her attempt to understand why he left. She had done the traditional therapy to work through it years ago, she had a solid grasp on the logic of it, but her inner child’s emotional heart space had remained broken and disjointed since he passed when she was just out of high school. That was 40 years ago. During this communication, her Dad instructed me to ask her to think about what she learned about herself from her Dad’s passing. What characteristics had she developed because she had to learn to do life without him? She paused for a moment, “strength, I learned to be so much stronger and independent after he died”. Again, she paused thinking, “To be capable!” she exclaimed. “I am so much more competent in my abilities to do things and get life done because he was that person for my Mom and me, and after he died I knew I needed to still help my Mom. I can do things most women wouldn’t even think of”. She held back tears as she continued, “I owe so much of who I am and who I became to him because I knew I had to take care of myself. He always told me to go to school, get a good job and learn to take care of myself. When he died I wanted to quit college, but I heard his voice in my head telling me over and over again to keep going, so I did. I graduated, got a great job, later started my own business and have had an amazing career, and life. I guess I am who I am because he died! That’s so crazy to say!” and yet, there it was. The insight he had been wanting her to come to, their souls contract fulfilled, she now understood. Does that mean she doesn’t still miss him? Of course not. The adult woman still wants to sit with him and tell him everything, that part doesn’t change. Yet, her perspective on his passing had completely shifted. The need to understand why totally disappeared. In its place, was peace.\nAt the end of our session, she told me how much better she felt, and in her heart was a place of freedom and openness she hadn’t felt since he died. The space which previously held his memory locked behind the door of not understanding was lifted away. Now they have a chance at connection.\nIn the physical world nothing changed. She didn’t lose 50 pounds, she didn’t win the lottery (well kind of maybe), nothing about her physically changed, but inside…that’s where it matters most.\nIt’s amazing what can happen when we’re willing to sit and look back at where we’ve come from. How differently things look from a new vantage point. It’s incredible how we can live in a state that seems so certain, only to take one look in a new direction, that changes our entire world."}
{"text": "New Hampshire passed a law prohibiting the transfer of doctors’ prescription history to facilitate drug companies’ one-on-one marketing — a practice known as “detailing” — because it believes detailing drives up brand-name drug sales and, in turn, health care costs. The state knew that the First Amendment prevented it from banning detailing itself, so it made the practice more difficult indirectly.\nYet data collection and transfer is protected speech — think academic research, or the phone book — and government efforts to regulate this type of speech also runs afoul of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Solveig Singleton, “Privacy as Censorship: A Skeptical View of Proposals to Regulate Privacy in the Private Sector” (Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 295). New Hampshire also engages in gross viewpoint discrimination: it exempts insurers’ efforts to persuade doctors to use generic drugs, and runs an “academic detailing” program to discourage brand-name drug use.\nRemarkably, the First Circuit reversed a district court ruling that had invalidated the statute as unconstitutional, somehow finding that the statute regulates conduct rather than speech and that, in any event, the judiciary should defer to the legislative branch’s judgment. Two companies that collect and sell health information and analysis filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the case. Cato, joining Washington Legal Foundation, Reason Foundation, and a group of current and former state officials, has filed a brief supporting that petition.\nOur brief argues that the Supreme Court should grant review because: 1) the speech at issue is worthy of First Amendment protection; 2) this case is a good vehicle for examining First Amendment issues attending state attempts to control health care costs (other states have passed similar laws); and 3) the lower court’s holding that a state may restrict speech to “level the playing field” conflicts with the Court’s precedent regarding both commercial speech and campaign finance regulation.\nThe Supreme Court will be deciding over the summer whether to grant review, with a decision expected after the “Long Conference,” which precedes the beginning of the new term in October."}

An investigation was launched last year after Northumbria Police received intelligence about a suspected Lithuanian organised crime group understood to be operating in the city.\nEnquiries led officers to believe that a factory had been set up in the North Shields and men were being trafficked from Eastern Europe to work across the region. Police believe those carrying out the work would be housed in shared accommodation and their wages and benefits would be controlled by their employers. It is suspected that the men worked as charity bag collectors through a third party and that they would travel across Newcastle to collect donations of clothes.\nEastern European gangs are known to collect donated clothing before legitimate charities or set up fake charities to steal the garments.\nHMRC is also running a separate investigation to establish whether any of the proceeds from the illegal business are going to the charities in question.

Even with investment education and better default investment options for 401(k) plan participants, DC plans do not replicate all the advantages of DB plans and are unlikely to outperform DB plans, which generally have extended investment horizons and economies of scale,” said Mark Warshawsky, director of retirement research at Towers Watson.\nThe analysis, which is based on pension plan reports employers file with the federal government, looks at individual years. In 2007, the most recent year included in the analysis, it found that the median rate of return for defined-benefit plans was 7.71 percent, compared with 6.78 percent for 401(k) plans.\nThe biggest difference during the 13-year period was in 2000, when the median rate of return for defined-benefit plans was -0.01 percent, compared with a 401(k) plan loss of 2.76 percent.\nThe highest rate of return for defined-benefit plans during the 13 years was in 2003, with a median rate of return of 21.35 percent. During the same period, 401(k) plans registered a 19.68 percent median rate of return.\nThe top year for 401(k) plans was 1997, when the median rate of return was 19.73 percent, compared with 18.82 percent for defined-benefit plans.\nIn all, median rates of return for defined-benefit plans were higher than 401(k) plans in nine of the 13 years analyzed by Towers Watson.\nStill, despite generating higher investment returns, the number of defined-benefit plans open to new employees continues to fall. As of May 2009, 45 percent of Fortune 100 companies offered a defined-benefit plan to new salaried employees, down from 90 percent in 1998, according to an analysis last year by Watson Wyatt Worldwide prior to its merger with Towers Perrin. By contrast, 55 percent of Fortune 100 companies offered only a defined-contribution plan to new salaried employees last year, compared with 10 percent in 1998.\nEmployers cite many reasons for moving away from defined-benefit plans. One is the unpredictability of the amount of required contributions, due to the swings of investment results and interest rates. Another is their concern about future costs as plan participants live longer.\nWorkforce Management.

{"text": "Social power is about influence. \"\nThursday, May 6, 2010\nFive Bases of Power\nChapter 15 discusses the five bases of power social power, as presented by the work of John French and Bertram Raven. The five bases of power are reward, coercive, legitimate, expert, and referent. A person can obtain compliance from another person by exerting these types of social influence, and sometimes people don't even know they are doing it. Knowledge of these types of social influences that lead to power can help one to behave morally or immorally, and can help one to further their progress in an organization. The exertions of these types of power can also be beneficial or hurtful to an organization's objectives, depending on how they are used by an individual to gain power. For example, reward power can be detrimental to the effectiveness of teamwork because a reward system might increase competition among individuals and make others feel left out. The organization of the reward system is crucial in this regard. Another example is coercive power, which can cause an individual to feel manipulated, or simply used as a stepping stone for another's benefit. Each type of social influence leaves a lasting imprint on the relationships between individuals in every organization."}

{"text": "Choosing a camera type: Advice to help you buy a camera. We describe the difference between a compact camera, a superzoom camera, DSLR camera and compact system cameras (hybrids).\nDeciding on a new camera can be a daunting task, not least because of the wealth of options available. What Digital Camera runs through the main types of digital camera available to help you buy a camera best suited to your needs.\nDigital compact cameras\nThere are a range of types of compact cameras, described below. If you decide you want one of these, you can check out our advice on choosing which compact camera to buy.\nCamera type: Simple point and shoot\nCompact cameras under £100 tend to be simple, no-frills models, that are perfectly capable of taking pictures without any extra bells and whistles. Typically these are powered by AA batteries as opposed to rechargeable lithium-ion types, but these deplete their charge quickly and so aren’t very economical. A better solution is to invest in a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger – while this will be initially more expensive, such batteries offer the best performance and can be used time and time again.\nMost budget compacts offer lenses with a 3x optical zoom, which will ordinarily stretch from around 35-105mm. This is a capable range for everyday photography, although some cameras push the boundaries a little further to offer particularly wide or long focal lengths. A camera with a lens starting at around 28mm will be perfectly suited to group shots and landscapes, while one which stretches to 140mm or 150mm is ideal for capturing far away details. As a rule, anything with an optical zoom over 3x is better than average, and so is worth a closer look.\nThe last few years have seen fierce competition among manufacturers to bring high-end features down to a lower price point. Something which has slowly grown over the years in the size of a cameras’ LCD screens; 2.5in is standard for budget models, though 2.7in and even 3in screens are now appearing at this price point. These may not improve your picture taking as such, but they do provide a better view of the scene and your captured images. Something else to look out for is image stabilisation – while the systems on such cameras aren’t quite as advanced as those on higher-end models, they do generally work and can help you capture sharper images.\nLastly, it’s not worth thinking too much over the number of megapixels such cameras have, as they all have enough. In fact, more megapixels can be detrimental to image quality, (particularly when shooting in low light) and these images take up more space on your memory card. Unless you have a specific reason for needing more megapixels, bear in mind that less is often more.\nGreat for: first-time users, children\nNot so great for: anyone wanting to take control over camera functionality\nCamera type: Standard compact cameras\nThe majority of compacts are priced between £100-250. A number of these offer wideangle lenses, and practically all of them work on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries which are supplied with the camera. At the budget end of the scale the focus is decidedly on style, with slim and colourful bodies and an array of trendy features such as HD video recording and face and smile detection included. More expensive models may incorporate longer zoom lenses and larger LCD screens, and may even offer touch-screen functionality.\nMany of these cameras offer some form of auto-intelligence, which automatically adjusts a number of settings according to the subject matter. This ideal for less confident users, who may be confused by certain settings. If action photography is your domain it’s worth looking at some of Casio’s compacts, which among them offer very fast burst rates for capturing motion. However, if it’s style and portability you’re after, Sony’s Cyber-shot range is a good place to look, as many models are either slim, colourful, packed full of technology, or all of the above.\nWhile such cameras are good general purpose models, they may put off larger-handed users or those used to the larger controls of an SLR. With the exception of touch-screen models, where control is through a series of virtual buttons on the LCD screen, the way these cameras operate is through an assortment of buttons and a menu pad on the rear. These can often be quite small and it may be difficult to see what you’re pressing, particularly as not all camera have these options clearly engraved.\nGreat for: Slipping in a bag/purse, style-conscious users\nNot so great for: Larger-handed users\nCamera type: Enthusiast compact cameras\nEnthusiast compacts aim to bring a high standard of image quality to a small camera. This is typically achieved with a larger-than-usual sensor and a high-quality optic, together with manual control and a superior build quality. When lighting conditions are good and correct photographic technique is employed, such cameras can produce DSLR-like results – which makes them ideal backup cameras to more expensive models. Even when light levels drop, the noise control offered by these cameras is generally good, even if it isn’t quite up to the standard of DSLRs.\nThese are also the cheapest types of camera to offer Raw recording, should you wish to take processing into your own hands. Some models also offer hotshoes for external accessories, such as viewfinder and flashguns, while a couple of those with longer lenses also manage to squeeze in GPS recording should you be travelling around.\nFor more critical captures some cameras offer high-resolution LCD screens, ones which match the quality of those on many recent DSLRs. As these allow you to zoom into an image without the quality degrading, these are ideal for checking finer details post capture, or for checking correct focus as you compose.\nGreat for: Creative photography on the fly, low-light situations\nNot so great for: Those on a budget, ‘point-and-shoot’\nSuperzoom bridge cameras\nCamera type: Superzoom cameras (also called Bridge cameras)\nSuperzoom cameras combine the flexibility of a wide focal range with a small format body. Many offer manual control over exposure (such as with an aperture or shutter priority option), and some allow you to manually focus too, meaning the photographer can take many decisions into their own hands.\nOne crucial aspect of a superzoom camera is its image stabilisation system. When shooting at longer focal lengths a camera has to work harder to keep the image stable, which makes a lens or sensor based image stabilisation system vital. Some cameras only offer sensitivity-based image stabilisation systems which work by increasing the camera’s ISO – this is something best avoided if one of the alternative two solutions are available.\nAnother popular feature on such models is an articulated LCD screen. These pull away from the body and allow you to shoot at awkward angles to the subject, such as at ground level. They may also help when shooting in bright conditions, as they can be adjusted to the angle with the least glare.\nGreat for: Outdoor activities, travel\nNot so great for: Slipping in your pocket\nInterchangeable lens cameras\nCamera type: Compact System (Hybrid/mirrorless) camera models\nWhile Compact System Cameras (or hybrids as they are sometimes known) have only been available for the past few years, they have significantly altered the photographic market. Some models use the same size of sensor found in DSLRs they are able to achieve a similar standard of image quality, where as others, such as the Pentax Q, use compact-sized sensors to reduce size even further. They can be made much smaller thanks to the lack of the traditional SLR mirror box. This does mean, however, that they cannot offer an optical viewfinder as standard – instead, some offer electronic viewfinders, while some simply have an LCD screen for composition.\nThe construction of hybrid models means they only offer a contrast-based method of autofocus, as opposed to DSLRs which offer a phase-detection system as standard. While manufacturers continue to make progress in this area, phase-detections systems are still the faster of the two at achieving focus. What this means is that for some subjects, where there is rapid movement requiring rapid focusing, a hybrid model won’t be ideal. For more general photography, however, these autofocus systems should suffice.\nAs a new and growing segment of the market, manufacturers are still building up lens options for these models. One of the advantages of these lenses is that, like the bodies on which they are mounted, they may be made smaller and lighter. For anyone wishing to travel light, a hybrid body with a couple of lenses may prove to be the best solution where image quality is key. As the first of these systems to enter the market, the Micro Four Thirds line has the most options at present, particularly as compatible lenses are being developed by both Olympus and Panasonic (as well as a few third-party manufacturers).\nGreat for: Alternative to enthusiast compacts, street and travel photography\nNot so great for: Any subject requiring the faster focusing a DSLR provides, viewfinder fans\nCamera type: DSLR cameras\nDSLR cameras offer the best image quality and more options than the other cameras featured here, although because of these factors they are also more expensive. Their larger sensors are able to produce better images in low-light conditions than with other cameras, and with a wider dynamic range too. Furthermore, they are designed to work with a range of high-quality lenses, meaning the photographer may choose one that’s been developed specifically to suit their requirements.\nMost DSLR cameras offer APS-C sensors, which are slightly larger than the Micro Four Thirds sensor but smaller than full-frame. This applies a conversion factor of around 1.5x to any mounted lens, which gives lenses a little extra reach. The Four Thirds system, which now consists of Olympus’s E-system range, increases this to 2x, doubling the effective focal length of any mounted lens. The downside of this is that wider angles are harder to achieve, and usually mean investing in either a full-frame body or a very wideangle lens which can tolerate some cropping.\nDSLRs also have the widest range of accessories at present. A plethora of lenses aside, all DSLRs accept flashguns on their hotshoe, and many also take extra battery grips for extra power and easier shooting in the portrait orientation. With HD video now a staple feature on DSLRs, it’s even possible to invest in an external microphones for stereo sound recording, while the shallow depth of field offered by a larger sensor can be a great benefit with regards to creativity and low-light shooting.\nGreat for: Image requiring the best quality, action photography, those looking to experiment with video recording\nNot so great for: Portability, those on a budget\nNow that you’ve chosen the type of camera you want: Check out our buying guides for more help choosing a camera or see our full range of equipment reviews"}
{"text": "We’re overdue for an update of Asia’s estimated infrastructure investment needs. ADB last estimated infrastructure investment needs for Asia and the Pacific in 2009. In a joint study with the ADB Institute, we identified the need for about $8 trillion worth of investment from 2010 to 2020, roughly $750 billion a year.\nWe’re now more than halfway through that timeline. Those estimates now speak more about the past than the future. Eight years to revisit these estimates is a long time, but the past eight years in particular have been tumultuous. Three big changes make it valuable to take a fresh look at Asia’s infrastructure investment needs.\nFirst is the new global and regional economic environment. In 2009, the world was still in the midst of the global financial crisis, and there was much uncertainty. In 2017, the picture is clearer: growth in many advanced economies is lackluster, particularly in Europe and Japan; some large emerging markets like Brazil and Russia are struggling, in part due to the fall in commodity prices; and growth has moderated in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\nAmid this challenging environment, growth in developing Asia as a whole is still robust. ADB forecasts regional GDP will grow by 5.7% this year. Infrastructure development will need to keep up with the pace of future economic expansion.\nSecond is our deeper understanding and appreciation of climate change and its impacts. This is what led 195 countries to sign on to the 2015 Paris Agreement and pledge to meet nationally determined contributions to help keep the increase in global temperatures below 2°C.\nClimate change matters for infrastructure in a couple of ways. There needs to be a shift toward “green” sources of energy to help countries meet their emissions reduction targets. And infrastructure needs to be “climate-proofed,” or made more resilient to changes such as rising sea levels and more extreme weather events.\nThe third big change is the rise of new initiatives and actors in Asia’s infrastructure development landscape. The PRC rolled out its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to support regional infrastructure. Two years later Japan launched its Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, which aims to provide $110 billion for regional infrastructure development by 2020. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) began operations in 2016 with $100 billion in capital, and extended $1.7 billion in loans in its first year of operations. Existing players are ramping up operations – ADB’s lending rose 17% last year to $31.5 billion, including cofinancing.\nAsia’s infrastructure needs are massive\nWhile some people like to focus on the competition among various actors and initiatives, the reality is that infrastructure needs far outstrip the capacity of any one program or institution. The needs are massive and there is enough space for everyone. At present, the supply of feasible projects is as much a constraint as the availability of finance. Institutions like ADB and AIIB can help here as well by providing technical assistance to help governments with the challenging work of preparing feasible projects for investment.\nIn light of these changes, ADB studied the region’s investment requirements and published its findings in a new report, Meeting Asia’s Infrastructure Needs.\nThe report incorporates the latest views on Asia’s growth trajectory. It accounts for the impact that climate change will have on the region’s infrastructure needs, and identifies how development partners can support countries to ensure infrastructure remains an enabler of growth and not a limitation.\nThe updated estimates are eye-popping. When climate change and new growth projections are factored in, developing Asia will need about $26 trillion in infrastructure investment between 2016 and 2030. That amounts to $1.7 trillion a year, or more than twice our 2009 forecasts.\nThe increase is due to higher GDP estimates, the inclusion of climate change-related investments, the use of 2015 prices instead of 2008 prices, and a wider country pool. But the really important point is that the projected needs are almost twice the roughly $900 billion a year that the region currently invests in infrastructure.\nThe public sector, which still accounts for most infrastructure investment in the region, has the potential to finance just over half of the needed investment. This implies that private sector involvement in infrastructure will have to increase big-time – probably three or four times current levels. This will require deeper capital markets, a greater supply of financially viable projects, and improvements in the legal and regulatory environment in many countries.\nAsian economies face a large task to deliver the infrastructure they will need to sustain growth and deal with climate change. Let’s get started. #LetsBuildAsia.\nAbdul Abiad is Advisor, Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, Asian Development Bank. This post is republished from the ADB Blog."}

There are many proven ways on how to throw a cast net. There is a list of suggested instructions for each cast net. Following these simple steps will help you learn some tips on throwing a net effectively.\n1. Attach the lead line throughout your left wrist. The left hand should be placed in the second loop then haul the line to secure it around your wrist.\n2. Release the net and line at your feet. Circle the line in your left hand until you unload all the looseness from the line and your left hand held about chest level.\n3. Cinch the slide ring on the lead line, which is at the center, with your right hand. Then glide it up the lead line into your left hand. You will observe the net extended as the slider ring is carried along the lead line. When you are able to elevate the net off of the deck with the slider ring, the net should be suspended straight down along with all the lead weights around the undermost skirt hanging about the same height in a lump. Disentangle the filaments on the innermost part of the net before continuing if the weights are not hanging equally.\n4. Hold the net with your right hand to going to the bottom about half of the way after the slider ring is fixed in your left hand. Pass the net culled to your left hand in your right without dropping the coil. If your left hand seem uneasily crowded, you may hold the net just below the coil instead of the ring itself.\n5. Hold a portion of the bottom skirt which is in between the weights and put the portion in your teeth. Then hold the skirt at a point, arms-length from the portion in your teeth in counter-clockwise.\n6.At the waist, after turning to your the left, wind up and throw the net by turning to your right and let go of all points instantly.

This means it is also time for the second edition of the Lathisms calendar, a website celebrating accomplishments by Hispanic and Latinx mathematicians. This website, aka the best thing ever, combines the inspirational power of seeing lots of Hispanic and Latinx success stories, with the excitement of an advent calendar. It always has me thinking: “who will be featured next?” and it’s always particularly exciting when it’s a person I know.\nThe calendar is the brainchild of some pretty wonderful people: Alexander Diaz-Lopez, Pamela E. Harris, Alicia Prieto Langarica, and Gabriel Sosa — all of whom of course are too modest to include themselves in the list but definitely deserve a spot on it. Last year, after the inauguration of the calendar, Evelyn Lamb published a great interview with the creators of the website on the AMS Blog on Math Blogs.\nBut besides being inspirational and fun, this calendar is important. It matters that we can show SO MANY people who are doing mathematics at a high level and are also Hispanic/Latinx. It matters because I have had a place to point to when my Hispanic/Latinx students feel like they don’t belong in math. And it matters as a resource for people thinking about conferences and sessions.\nOn that note, I also wanted to remind people of the wonderful Mathematically Gifted and Black, an equally important, wonderful and fun calendar which was unveiled during Black History Month earlier this year.\nI invite you all to check daily for the next mathematician and I leave you with some wise words from Federico Ardila (who was featured in last year’s calendar)."}

{"text": "“Meditation opens the common ground between all traditions and cultures, religious, secular and scientific. In a world that is growing increasingly aware of its need for stability and depth, Christian Meditation is speaking to more and more people. This prayer of silence, found in Christian tradition from earliest times, leads us beyond words, thoughts and images to experience the presence of Christ within us. Christian Meditation is central to the Christian experience and is available to all.”\nChristian Meditation is a group that meditates and practices contemplative prayer as passed on through the teaching John Main OSB. Rooted in Christian tradition from the earliest times, meditation is a way of simplicity in which we quiet the mind and become still and attentive to God. It is a prayer of silence, which takes us beyond words, thoughts and images to experience the presence of Christ within us. The meetings are every Tuesday at 7:00 PM in the rectory basement. The session lasts for an hour and consists of listening to an inspirational talk on meditation, followed by 25 minutes of silent meditation. There is also a time of sharing and questions if needed.\nContacts: Ted and Cora Alcuitas email: firstname.lastname@example.org\nBarry Desmond email: email@example.com\nMichel and Rosemary Chan Fong email: firstname.lastname@example.org\nChristian Meditation: “Be Still and know that I am God”\nIn 1975, John Main OSB (1926-1982) opened the first Christian Meditation Centre at his monastery in London, England. He had recovered a simple tradition of silent, contemplative prayer from the teachings of St. John Cassian and the 4th century Desert Fathers. Meditation is also found in the 14th century spiritual classic, The Cloud of Unknowing. It soon became clear to him that this tradition has relevance today, not only for monks but for all contemporary men and women. He saw it as a way to the renewal of the church and the world.\nIn 1977, he came to Canada at the invitation of the bishop of Montreal, Bishop Crowley, to establish a priory for the purpose of practicing and teaching meditation. The first meditation group of lay people was then started which is today still continuing. Other groups around Canada has since blossomed including several groups in the lower mainland BC. Our group at St. Mary’s is part of the Canadian Christian Meditation Community as well as the World Community for Chritisn Meditation with Fr. Laurence Freeman, OSB as spiritual director.\nOur group at St. Mary’s was started by the late Sr. Charlotte Girard, a sister of the Child Jesus in 2003. Fr. Pierre was a regular meditator with us as well as Fr. Larry Lynn before he heard his calling to the priesthood.\nOur group at St. Mary’s meets for meditation once a week on Tuesdays at 7:00 pm at the Rectory Basement."}
{"text": "Moschnyi is the southern most Chernarussian territory. It is an island located east of Novigrad and south of Primorsk. The southern coast has been pummeled by wind and rough seas for centuries leaving a slowly receeding cliff face lining the coast. The grounds above the cliffs contain only bushes and grass due to the brutal winds from the south. There are no trees until one reaches the northern side of the island where the slow descent to the northern coast shields trees from the wind. There are few crops that grow on the grounds of Moschnyi but the open fields are commonly grazed by domesticated animals including, sheep, cows, and goat.\nTwo bays, the old harbor in the town of Moschnyi and the new harbor in Novakvice can be found along the northern coast. Additionally, a ferry\non the north-west coast near the town of Moschnyi links the island to the mainland across the Strait of Moschnyi.\nThe two main towns on the island are Moschnyi and Novakvice. Smaller towns include Lipnice, Murnice, and Kyslin. Moschnyi has both the only fuel station and only large market on the island. Novakvice is the newer port and has better facilities for bigger ships due to the proximity of the mine on the eastern edge of town. Kyslin, Murnice, and Lipnice contain mostly open fields on their non-coastal perimeters and the majority of this land is used for the grazing domesticated animals. Water and power on Moschnyi are provided by the mainland and are connected to Moschnyi via underwater cables and pipes that lead to the utilities station\nto the west of the ferry terminal. Governor Banik of the Novigrad District maintains a residence on the northern coast between Moschnyi and Kyslin. The islands only other notable figure is Mstislav Skala, owner of a large transportation company\nboth on the island and throughout the rest of Chernarus with a few warehouses in Takistan, Russia, and Ardistan. He is a suspected member, and possibly key figure, of the Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star\nThere are no military bases located on the island but there is a small military base across the strait.

{"text": "I just finished Neal Stephenson's famous 1992 sci-fi satire novel Snow Crash, which is kind of like The Da Vinci Code for smart people (although I imagine Dan Brown was inspired, if that's the word for it, more by Umberto Eco's 1989 bestseller Foucault's Pendulum).\nIt must have been a startlingly great book back in 1992. It's the early 21st Century in Los Angeles, and government has fallen apart just about everywhere in the world, except perhaps Japan. Private enterprise has taken over all the functions of the state. A few ethnic groups -- the Cantonese and the Sicilians -- are flourishing in the absence of public order (indeed the Mafia are pretty close to being the good guys in the novel). I guess a lot of libertarians see it as a utopian novel, but I doubt if Stephenson would agree. (Here's an interview with him in Reason magazine where he appears to be implicitly suggesting that libertarianism is another mind-virus.)\nA major plot element in Snow Crash is the Raft, a vast agglomeration of flotsam, inhabited by impoverished south and southeast Asian refugees drifting inexorably across the Pacific, headed for California. Stephenson's description of The Raft is a pretty funny variation on the usual sentimental cant about how illegal immigrants have more gumption than us natives, and thus are just what us decadent Americans need:\n\"When [the Raft] gets to California, it will enter a new phase of its life cycle. It will shed much of its sprawling improvised bulk as a few hundred thousand Refus cut themselves loose and paddle to shore. The only Refus who make it that far are, by definition, the ones who were agile enough to make it out to the Raft in the first place, resourceful enough to survive the agonizingly slow passage through arctic waters, and tough enough not to get killed by any of the other Refus. Nice guys, all of them. Just the kind of people you'd like to have showing up on your private beach in groups of a few thousand.\" [p. 272]\nClearly, Stephenson picked up his idea for the Raft from Jean Raspail's 1973 novel The Camp of the Saints, which is about a similar ramshackle armada heading from south Asia to the south of France. So, I went to Google to read about the influence of Camp of the Saints on Snow Crash. As a cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash is, unsurprisingly, much discussed on the Internet, with 360,000 Google hits. Camp of the Saints shows up in 53,000 places.\nAnd how many webpages discuss the overlap between them? As far as I can tell, exactly one."}
{"text": "If you stop and think about it for a moment, a f.w.d. car like the Cord 810 or 812 was the perfect car for use up in Canada, were winters are quite long and snowy. The car pictured here, is an 812 Sportsman convertible shown posed on an icy driveway. Only three thousand Cords were produced in 1936 for the 810 model run, but many remained unsold and were re-numbered as the 812 model for 1937, the final year of E. L. Cord’s automotive empire.\nSo much has been written in the press about this timeless beauty, that we thought we would take a different look at the car and focus on its styling. This Cord like so many other landmark designs, seems to have evolved over time. The first two patent drawings, dated May 17, 1934, by the very talented designer Gordon M. Buehrig, (above and below left), show the basic design that was used in production with a few exceptions, the first is he had planned to add radiators below the wing-shaped panels between the hood and fenders. The headlights also were planed to open out of the sides of the fenders instead of the front and one other difference noted, is the center pillar between the doors has a tapered shape as seen on some earlier Buehrig designs.\nThe photos (right above and left below), dated Aug. 5, 1935, show a close to finished design, shown in plan and side-views, with the grille being extended all the way back to the cowl below the hood. The combined front end and rear end views, show a design quite close to what ended up in production. The last photo (below right), dated May 11, 1936, shows the final “coffin-nosed” hood design, with seven horizontal louvers used on the standard production models. The supercharged 812 models had the side-pipes as seen on the photo at the top.\nYou can also see a Hollywood Graham here on The Old Motor, which used the left over body dies from the Cord for its last model run in 1940. More information about the very interesting Cord, can be found at the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg Club."}

The most widely planted red varietal is Cabernet Sauvignon, accounting for 12.2% of the total.\nShiraz accounts for 10%, while Merlot accounts for 6.4% and Pinotage, which is indigenous to South Africa, represents 6.2%.\nThe local wine industry continues to re-align its vineyard offering in line with international trends\nAccording to a study, commissioned by the SA Wine Industry Information & Systems (SAWIS) and published in December 2009, some 275.606 people were employed both directly and indirectly in the wine industry in 2008, including farm labourers, those involved in packaging, retailing and wine tourism.\nThe study also concluded that of the R26.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP) contributed by the wine industry to the regional economy, some R4.3 billion was generated indirectly through wine-tourism activities centred in the winelands.\nAbout R14.2 billion eventually would remain in the Western Cape to the benefit of its residents.\nGrowth in contribution to the GDP has been at least 10% per annum since 2003.\nIn terms of world wine production, South Africa ranks as number seven in overall volume production of wine and produces 3.0% of the world’s wine (2010).\nOf the country’s total annual harvest of 984.8 mill. litres in 2010, 79% was devoted to the making of wine, 4.0% to wine for brandy, 11.5% to distilling wine and 5.1% to grape juice concentrate and grape juice.\nOf the country’s estimated total annual harvest of 973.7 mill. litres in 2011, 80% was devoted to the making of wine, 3% to wine for brandy, 13% to distilling wine and 4% to grape juice concentrate and grape juice.\nExports of natural (i.e. non-fortified) packaged wines for the 2010 calendar year reached 222.3 mill. litres, a decrease of 7.3% on the previous year.\nRed wine exports decreased by 7.0% to account for 49.5% of all natural wines exported.\nTotal hectares for 2010 stand at 101.016 ha compared to 101.259 ha in 2009. This represents a decrease of 243 ha. Until 2006 the total surface showed an annual increase; since then a steady decrease totalling 1.130 ha.\nPinot Noir (Table 1) has, over the past 10 years, improved in ranking amongst the top 20 wine grape varieties, while Crouchen (Cape Riesling) moved down from 16th to 18th place.\nFor the period 2000 — 2010 the vineyard area as a percentage of the total area increased in Robertson, Worcester and Breedekloof regions, while decreasing in Malmesbury and Paarl (Table 2).\nRegarding individual wine grape varieties, Chenin blanc represented 24.1% of the total wine surface in 2000, Colombar 12.2%, Cabernet Sauvignon 9.4%, Pinotage 6.9%, Chardonnay 6.5%, Shiraz 6.0%, Sauvignon blanc 5.8%, followed by the varieties detailed in Table 4. In 2010 Chenin blanc (18.3%) decreased significantly. Red varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz increased significantly over this period.\nAs mentioned before a great concern is that since 2005 the industry has not been able to replace an annual 5%, about 5 000 ha, of existing vineyards. A life span of 20 years serves as guideline, but according to role players this is especially with regard to red varieties not attainable and a life span of 15 years is considered to be more realistic.\nFigure 8 and Table 5 gives an overview of the situation.\n|SOUTH AFRICA WINE INDUSTRY STATISTICS|\nWINE PRODUCED (Million Gross Litres)\nWINE GRAPES AS % OF TOTAL HECTARES\nAGE OF VINES AT 2010\n|Years||White %||Red %||Total %|\nTOTAL SA EXPORTS\n|1996||99 900 000||140|\n|1998||116 800 000||108|\n|2000||138 400 000||108|\n|2001||176 100 000||126|\n|2002||215 800 000||123|\n|2003||237 300 000||110|\n|2004||266 500 000||112|\n|2005||280 084 000||105|\n|2006||271 778 000||97|\n|2007||313 886 000||115|\n|2008||407 320 000||132|\n|2009||389 141 000||96|\n|2010||389 324 000||96|\nPACKAGED EXPORTS BY COUNTRY (Litres)\n|Bottled||2003 %||2009 %||2010 %|\nTOTAL PACKAGED WINE (Litres) EXPORT GROWTH TRENDS"}

{"text": "Academic researchers reported that all five standard hospital-based performance measures used to gauge quality of care for hospitalized heart failure patients may not be the best benchmarks since none were significant predictors of patient mortality during the critical first 60 to 90 days immediately following hospital discharge.\nPublished in the Jan. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study found that none of the current measures used by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) which accredits hospitals and by the Federal Government through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to assess hospital performance were associated with a lower risk of mortality during the days immediately following hospital discharge when adverse events are most likely to occur.\nOnly one of the standard measures modestly influenced mortality and rehospitalization rates. Researchers also reported that use of beta blocker medications in eligible heart failure patients at time of hospital discharge, currently not a JCAHO/CMS performance measure, was associated with the most significant improvements in heart failure patient outcomes - predictive of a 52 percent reduction in mortality during the first 60 to 90 day period after hospital discharge.\nProfessional societies, health care accrediting organizations, the government, and major insurers use performance measures to rank and accredit hospitals, rate quality of care, and develop hospital as well as physician pay-for- performance initiatives. According to researchers, performance measures should reflect the strongest clinical evidence in practice and failure to perform these key treatments should reduce the likelihood of optimal patient outcomes.\n\"The study's findings are quite surprising since it has been commonly held that existing performance measures could be used to distinguish hospitals that provide higher quality heart failure care and that these indicators were strongly linked to clinical outcomes.\" said Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, The Eliot Corday Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine and Science, principal investigator and director, Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center.\nFonarow added that the findings do not lessen the importance of providing recommended elements of heart failure care covered by the existing performance measures nor does it preclude these measures from influencing patient quality-of-life or long-term survival.\nHowever, Fonarow noted that the study does demonstrate that the factors influencing mortality and rehospitalization after discharge for heart failure may be driven by a different set of care processes and better methods for identifying and validating new performance measures are needed.\nResearchers utilized data on 5,791 patients seen at 91 hospitals, taken from a large heart failure patient registry and performance improvement program called the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF).\nResearchers statistically analyzed the relationship between the five standard performance measures and clinical outcomes within the 60 to 90 days after patient discharge. Four of these heart failure measures are currently used by JCAHO/CMS and are publicly reported on the Hospital Compare website: http://www.\nThe five measures, developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, included: 1) Giving complete medical instructions to patients upon hospital discharge; 2) Evaluation of the heart's left ventricle systolic function; 3) Prescribing patients an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) drugs; 4) Smoking cessation counseling and 5) Prescribing anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.\nResearchers also evaluated prescribing of a beta-blocker at hospital discharge, another key medication for heart failure that currently is not assessed with a performance measure.\nThe study determined that none of the five standard measures were significantly associated with reduced early mortality risk and only ACE inhibitor or ARB use modestly affected mortality or rehospitalization outcomes. Prescribing a beta-blocker in eligible patients, however, was strongly associated with lower mortality risk and lower death/rehospitalization risk.\n\"This study has identified and validated a new performance measure that could be used to augment existing measures and more effectively quantify the quality of care provided to heart failure patients in the hospital setting\" said Fonarow. \"If this beta-blocker measure was adopted by JCAHO/CMS and the levels of performance achieved by OPTIMIZE-HF hospitals in providing beta blockers were achieved by hospitals nationwide, we estimate that an additional 19,000 lives a year could be saved.\"\nThe investigators noted that while performance measures for heart attack have a strong association with mortality outcomes, the connection for heart failure measures have not been as well studied.\n\"While the current performance measures for heart failure have some rationale for their continued use, in determining which measures should be publicly reported and used for pay-for- performance programs, there should be better selection of measures that significantly influence patient outcomes early after hospital discharge.\" said Fonarow, Professor of Medicine, UCLA Division of Cardiology.\nFonarow added that it may be helpful to require hospitals to report actual patient outcomes such as mortality or mortality/rehospitalization rates in the first 30-90 days post-discharge to help track and identify which hospitals are providing better care. Currently hospitals only report in-hospital process of care data.\nOnly the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines - Heart Failure program, one of the national quality improvement programs for heart failure, routinely collects and reports on a beta-blocker performance measure for patients hospitalized with heart failure.\nHeart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in those over age 65 -- almost 3.6 million hospitalizations are attributed to heart failure as the primary or a secondary discharge diagnosis each year. The estimated direct and indirect costs of heart failure in 2006 are expected to be $29.6 billion. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to the body's other organs. The heart keeps working but not as efficiently as it should. This condition is caused by narrowed arteries, heart attack, high blood pressure, heart defects, infection or disease of the heart muscle or valves.\nGlaxoSmithKline sponsored the OPTIMIZE-HF registry and funded the study.

This event is free and open to the public.\n“King Corn,” directed by Aaron Woolf, follows Ellis and his best friend, Ian Cheney, on a year-long odyssey to understand where their food comes from… by growing it. In what\nThe Washington Post\ncalls “Required viewing for anyone planning to visit a supermarket, fast-food joint or their own refrigerator,” the city-slickers learn to drive a combine, cash in on government subsidies and homebrew high-fructose corn syrup. The duo’s Peabody-winning findings, shared with theatergoers in 60 cities and in a PBS national broadcast, has changed the way audiences eat.\nis the creator of several hit documentaries, including “The Greening of Southie,” “Big River” as well as “Truck Farm” and is co-founder of the national AmeriCorps program FOODCORPS. He is a passionate campaigner for changing the way Americaʼs next generation eats, builds and lives. Since graduating from Yale in 2002, Ellis has constructed green homes in Oregon and the Adirondacks; launched an award-winning documentary and an advocacy company Wicked Delicate; and grown 10,000 pounds of genetically-modified corn.\nToday, Ellis is busy leading FOODCORPS, an AmeriCorps school garden program. The organization recruits young leaders to spend a post-college year conducting nutrition education, building school gardens and sourcing farm-fresh food for children in high-obesity communities. FOODCORPS is on a fast track to become the “Teach for America” of school food, with its current class of 50 (selected from 1,229 applicants) set to double next year. The program educates vulnerable children about healthy food, engagement with how it grows and daily access to its nutrients in school lunch––all while launching a new generation of farmers and public health leaders.\nSpeaking engagements keep Ellis traveling throughout the year, and he has appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC and NPR as well as in\nThe New York Timesand Washington Post\n. Currently working under grants from the WK Kellogg Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, Ellis is a Draper Richards Kaplan Social Entrepreneur, a winner of the Heinz Award and a member of the board of directors of Slow Food USA.\nFor more information about this event, contact Dr. Bart Welling, UNF associate professor in the Department of English, at (904) 620-1268 or at"}
{"text": "Presentation on theme: \"Cell Adhesion and Extracellular Matrix. Cells in tissues can adhere directly to one another (cell–cell adhesion) through specialized integral membrane.\"— Presentation transcript:\nCells in tissues can adhere directly to one another (cell–cell adhesion) through specialized integral membrane proteins called cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) that often cluster into specialized cell junctions.\nCells in animal tissues also adhere indirectly (cell–matrix adhesion) through the binding of adhesion receptors in the plasma membrane to components of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM).\nThese two basic types of interactions not only allow cells to aggregate into distinct tissues but also provide a means for the bidirectional transfer of information between the exterior and the interior of cells.\nCAMs can be broadly distributed along the regions of plasma membranes that contact other cells or clustered in discrete patches or spots called cell junctions. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex meshwork of proteins and polysaccharides that contributes to the structure and function of a tissue.\nCell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate direct cell–cell adhesions and cell-surface adhesion receptors mediate cell–matrix adhesions. These interactions bind cells into tissues and facilitate communication between cells and their environments. The cytosolic domains of CAMs and adhesion receptors bind multifunctional adapter proteins that mediate interaction with cytoskeletal fibers and intracellular signaling proteins.\nThe major families of cell-surface adhesion molecules are the cadherins, selectins, Ig- superfamily CAMs, and integrins.\nCertain cell-surface receptors, including some integrins, can bind components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby indirectly adhering cells to each other through their interactions with the matrix. Three abundant ECM components are proteoglycans, a unique type of glycoprotein; collagens, proteins that often form fibers; and soluble multiadhesive matrix proteins (e.g., fibronectin).\nThe relative volumes of cells versus matrix vary greatly among different animal tissues and organs. Some connective tissue, for instance, is mostly matrix, whereas many organs are composed of very densely packed cells with relatively little matrix.\nAlthough the extracellular matrix generally provides mechanical support to tissues, it serves several other functions as well. Different combinations of ECM components tailor the extracellular matrix for specific purposes: strength in a tendon, tooth, or bone; cushioning in cartilage; and adhesion in most tissues.\nIn addition, the composition of the matrix, which can vary, depending on the anatomical site and physiological status of a tissue, can let a cell know where it is and what it should do (environmental cues).\nThe matrix also serves as a reservoir for many extracellular signaling molecules that control cell growth and differentiation. In addition, the matrix provides a lattice through or on which cells can move, particularly in the early stages of tissue assembly.\nMorphogenesis—the later stage of embryonic development in which tissues, organs, and body parts are formed by cell movements and rearrangements—also is critically dependent on cell–matrix adhesion as well as cell–cell adhesion."}

{"text": "Soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) also have a number of different monikers. Steamer clams, Ipswich clam, belly clam, and longneck clam, are all the same exact clam. Soft-shell clams must be dug by hand at low tide on the tidal “flats”. A short handled “fork” with long, thin tines is used in the excavation process. The thin shells are quite delicate, and a more than fair amount of finesse is required in the harvesting to prevent breakage. Either steamed, fried, or in a chowder, the soft shell clams are sure to please. We at J.P.'s Shellfish source our Maine soft-shell cams through the same Beals Island fishery that has fished the very same flats for three generations. Island Made Steamers harvests from only the most pristine areas which are constantly washed by the icy waters provided courtesy of the Gulf of Maine. The method of harvest has little to no effect on the surrounding environment. By the next low tide, there is nary a trace that the area had been dug up a scant 12 hours before. Soft-shell clams live for approximately seven to twelve years, and (not unlike the hard-shell clams) reach sexual maturity by the end of their first year. There is a single breeding season for the soft-shell clams, and a one-year-old female will typically produce 1-1.5 million eggs. Clams are available in ten pound, half-bushel (+/- 24 pound) and bushel (+/- 48 pound) units.\nUpon receipt, soft-shell clams should be immediately placed in refrigeration,and stored in the exact same fashion as their hard-shell cousins. Keep them in a dry and well-ventilated climate, which is held between 34 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit. It is a good idea to physically flip the clam container (bag or box) every day to allow those clams on the bottom of the pack relief from the collective weight of their brethren on top of them. Before preparing, check each and every clam by either lightly tapping its shell or touching the siphon with a finger, fork, etc. You should see the shell close, and or the siphon draw inwards, if there is no such movement, immediately discard the clam in question. If handled properly, and kept under the aforementioned conditions, the live soft-shell clams should have a life expectancy of no less than 10 days after their harvest date.\nPlease email firstname.lastname@example.org or call 207-439-6018 for more information on this and or any other J.P.'s Shellfish product or service."}

{"text": "June 17, 2021\nVacuum manufacturer Leybold celebrates 170th birthday - Traditionally, companies can only be sustainable if they are innovative. The vacuum specialist Leybold succeeded with its combination of tradition and innovation over the course of its history. With this in mind, Leybold is proud to honor this important milestone by celebrating its 170th birthday in 2020.\nWithout the tireless work and commitment of several generations of dedicated employees, this anniversary would not have been possible. The businessman Ernst Leybold laid the foundation in 1850, when he moved from Rotenburg ob der Tauber to Cologne founding his first company. Initially as a commission and forwarding agency for medical glassware, ointment pots, thermometer and scales; he expanded his range of products in 1854 to include physical, pharmaceutical and chemical apparatus. Leybold finally sold his business in 1870, though it continued to operate under the name of E. Leybold’s Nachfolger.\nThe triumphant procession of vacuum technology began in 1906 through collaboration with Dr. Wolfgang Gaede, professor of physics in Karlsruhe. Gaede’s work ethic was characterized by efficiency: “If I pursue an idea out of scientific interest, I always come up with an invention.” The cooperation between Leybold and Gaede was accordingly beneficial, among other things it produced innovations which are still very important today, such as the invention of the molecular air pump, the basic principle of the turbomolecular pump (1911), and the use of the diffusion pump (1913). Diffusion pumps have no moving parts – their operating principle is based on vaporous propellants and enables reliable, low-maintenance operation. These robust “workhorses” are still used in applications today. Gaede’s gas ballast device for efficient pumping of vapors – patented in 1935 – is still used in many applications today.\nThe year 1913 marks the beginning of vacuum metallurgy. At that time, Dr. Wilhelm Rohn, head of the physical test laboratory at W.C. Heraeus GmbH in Hanau, developed a process for melting high-purity metals under vacuum. Interrupted by WWI the “process for vacuum melting and tempering of metals and alloys” could only be patented after the war in 1918. In 1931 Wilhelm Carl Heraeus succeeded in vaporizing metals onto glass – another milestone in vacuum coating technology.\nDr. Manfred Dunkel took over as managing director at E. Leybold’s Nachfolger in the same year (1931) and led the company successfully until 1967. This period was defining, as vacuum technology was increasingly used in the florishing industry during this time. Therefore, technical and scientific knowledge as well as management skills were required, in order to transfer the findings into process engineering applications.\nhe Metallgesellschaft AG and the Degussa AG secured participations in E. Leybold’s Nachfolger in 1948 and 1955. This generated synergies, ensured success on the world markets and led to a merger of E. Leybold’s Nachfolger and Heraeus Hochvakuum GmbH in 1967. The result was a well-mixed portfolio of vacuum technology and vacuum process engineering. Further growth resulted from product developments such as cryogenic pumps with liquid helium (1962), and helium leak detectors. In 1963, Ion atomizer pumps were presented for the first time.\nThe 1980s were shaped by strong growth. By 1987, Leybold had expanded to about 5600 employees and achieved a turnover of more than one billion D-Mark. Fundamental changes in the ownership structure took place within the same year; The Metallgesellschaft AG withdrew as a shareholder and W.C. Heraeus also disposed of its shares. This resulted in the Degussa AG now being the sole shareholder. The headquarters of the ‚Leybold AG’ and the sector of vacuum process technology moved to the Hanau location.\nVacuum Technology was located in Cologne and scientific and technical teaching materials were in Hürth. With the opening of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the economic downturn of the western industrialized countries, the new Leybold AG experienced great economic turbulence. This resulted in the Degussa AG selling its shares to the Oerlikon-Bührle Group (Switzerland) in 1994. 1995, the Leybold AG and the Balzers AG were merged into the Balzers and Leybold Group.\nIn 1997, Leybold GmbH founded a wholly owned subsidiary in China in order to profit from the high potential of the emerging economic region and customer proximity. In 2000, the Oerlikon-Bührle Group was renamed UNAXIS, accompanied by extensive restructuring by focusing on semiconductor related technologies. This required innovations in the manufacturing technology which Leybold met by opening the new production building for high vacuum technology in Cologne in 2004. Supported by economic growth, the UNAXIS Group was renamed to “Oerlikon” in 2006. Leybold operated under the name Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum until its sale to Atlas Copco.\nIn 2016, the Swedish Atlas Copco AB acquired Leybold. Atlas Copco is a multi-brand group with customers in over 180 countries and about 37000 employees. Today, Leybold is part of Atlas Copco’s Vacuum Technique business area. Atlas Copco is relying on Leybold’s traditional brand strength and on complementing the innovative technological know-how.\nFor 170 years, Leybold - with headquarters in Cologne, Germany - has been developing and supplying vacuum pumps, systems, standardized and customized vacuum solutions and services for many different industries. Today, Leybold is leading as a supplier of vacuum technology in many industrial applications; such as metallurgy and industrial coating technology. The synergetic performance of Atlas Copco and Leybold in the fields of industrial dry vacuum pumps and high vacuum pumps for science and research has created a technological platform for the development of sustainable high-performance products for future generations."}
{"text": "10 Bizarre Human Mysteries\nWARNING: this list contains some graphic images. Every so often, we’ll come across strange and inexplicable conditions found in the human body. These are the mysteries science can’t easily debunk, the kinds that defy natural laws and how we’ve come to understand ourselves. There’s always debate concerning these supposed powers. Are they just hoaxes derived from our imagination, or are we looking at the first steps into the next evolutionary leap? So here’s what we’ve seen; you decide what to believe from these bizarre human mysteries.\nShamanistic practices were once much more prevalent in the world, and considered a profound foundation of the tribes that believed in them. These spiritually based rituals are still found today and are revered as legitimate procedures. In the Philippines, an entrancing healer, allegedly, has the ability to materialize and dematerialize matter. The shaman will enter a mild trance, where they gain the supernatural ability to perform surgeries with little to no contact with the patient. They would then be able to remove foreign objects within the body such as glass and metal and provide alleviation from similar pains.\nMany of these shamans have been discovered as fraudulent, proving the use of slight of hand tricks and passing them off as legitimate procedures, but that isn’t the case for all of them. Some entrancing healers can pull out molars with their bare hands, while others can remove and replace eyeballs. There is still not enough evidence to dismiss what these shamans have been apparently able to achieve for decades.\nMuch like entrancing healers, psychic surgeons can perform procedures that would normally require tools and what we consider conventional medical supplies (like anesthesia). But, unlike the healers, psychic surgeons go deep into the patient’s body, and literally pull out tumors and organs from their patients.\nThese types of surgeons are mostly found in Brazil and the Philippines, where people strongly believe in spirits (which aid every procedure/treatment). Patients are told to recognize that negative feelings and thoughts toward disease and illnesses only serve to aggravate the condition, and that they can’t be healed if they don’t believe in the possibility of overcoming it. In other words, they must form a bond between the mind, body and spirit, to achieve the balance required for recovery; the body can’t be healed if the mind and spirit aren’t aligned. This is also the reason why psychic surgeons argue that outsiders who come to them seeking help are more difficult to work on because they lack that faith.\nSHC is burning from the inside out. It certainly sounds strange but by now, most of us are familiar with this supposed phenomenon. Famous cases include Jack Angel’s account of SHC that led to his hand needing amputation, or Mary Reeser who was burned to a crisp and found with a shrunken skull. Even fiction has its examples of SHC, as seen in Charles Dicken’s novel, Bleak House (Dickens was fascinated by the topic and researched it thoroughly).\nAlready you can probably come up with a few facts off the top of your head that would debunk this mystery, but consider this: crematoriums pre-heat their furnaces to about 1837.4 degrees Fahrenheit, because the human body is relatively difficult to burn. It takes between one and two hours for tissue and major bones to become ashes. SHC victims are usually found in a liquid form, meaning their bodies had to burn at a temperature exceeding 2998 degrees Fahrenheit. And in some cases, not the entire body is burned and we’d expect to see burn marks all over the body in a traditional house fire scenario.\nOn the subject of fire, we come to the Leidenfrost effect. The effect actually creates an insulating, protective barrier of vapor that forms over a liquid exposed to extreme heat. This same effect protects you when you pinch out candles with wet fingers. It’s a phenomenon we’re all capable of doing given the right circumstances (like in firewalking), but it’s only a fraction of what people with fire immunity experience.\nNathan Coker was a blacksmith in Maryland who could stand on white hot metal, swill molten lead shot in his mouth until it solidified, and hold red-hot coals. His skin was so dexterous, he never even showed signs of burn marks. Is it a practice of mind over matter or did his skin, over years of handling fire, get tough enough to keep him from feeling the burn?\nOn the opposite spectrum, pyrokinetics can attract or project fire. A.W. Underwood was able to cause a handkerchief to burst in to flames by blowing on it. Starting a fire with the mind, or a wave of the hand, is rejected much quicker than those that have fire immunity but it remains the favorite in fiction.\nDowsing has existed as early as the 15th century. Using a divining rod, a dowser may find water, metals and other substances in the ground without the use of scientific tools. The thought is that divining rods amplify invisible movements of the hand coming from the dowser who has some ability to sense magnetic fields or may possess a form of ESP.\nOne way to explain the phenomenon is by exploring the environment. If a dowser can detect hints about their surroundings, then they make subconscious movements with their hands, forcing the rods to shake and dip, indicating they’ve found something of value. Most dowsers can’t offer a plain explanation how the process works but the practice has been used to locate substances successfully throughout the centuries.\nYou have probably seen Youtube videos of people showing signs of bioelectricity. As early as the 19th century, there have been cases of people being electrically charged or magnetized, resulting in an odd electromagnetic effect on the objects around them. Some people even show allergic reactions to technology, finding it difficult to live around devices that emit too much magnetic and electrical charge.\nThere have been cases of people being so charged that they are able to light a bulb simply by holding it. Others cause fuses to blow out, without any means of controlling the effect. It’s even been recorded that people with this strong force can give a static electricity shock continuously, and be powerful enough to actually hurt someone.\nSurprisingly, most cases on bioluminescence in humans comes from ill patients. Anna Monaro had asthma and for several weeks, a blue glow would emit from her chest while she slept. In his book ‘Death: Its Causes and Phenomena’, Hereward Carrington reported the body of a boy radiating a blue glow after his death of acute indigestion.\nThis glow-worm effect still doesn’t have many cases, but recently Japanese researchers discovered that the human body glimmers. The light we emit is about 1000 times lower than the naked eye can see. This light fluctuates during the day, in cycles, leaving us brightest in the afternoon (the skin around your mouth lightens most around this time of day too) and dimmest in the evening.\nD.D. Home was a famous medium who had many witnesses claim he could indeed levitate. Homes most incredible feat happened in 1868, when he floated out one window and into another during a séance. His abilities were never proven to be fraudulent, even by Harry Houdini, who attempted to duplicate many of Homes “tricks.”\nToday, levitation is common during magical performances, but they all came from reports of people actually floating. It was considered a normal occurrence in séance, not just by the people in attendance, but of the objects around them. And if you ever want to experience levitation for yourself, try the Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board game. It’s been scaring kids for years now.\nESP is an extrasensory perception, able to gain information through use of a sense unknown by science. Before getting into ESP, first you should realize you do in fact have more than five senses. You can sense temperature variations, proprioception (position of your muscles), and the force of gravity (you do this by knowing at what angle your head is in while your eyes are shut). ESP covers the senses that are left.\nThere’s plenty of anecdotal evidence of ESP, but what about legitimate science? In the 30s, the Ganzfeld experiments took place. People claiming to have ESP were told to lie down, and then forced to listen to white noise to clear their minds. Someone observing from another room would then attempt to mentally send him/her an image. Afterward, that person would pick which image it is they saw in their mind from four. Critics predicted a 25% accuracy but were surprised to learn it was 35%. That isn’t statistically a lot more but this experiment was used to show that perhaps there was something to ESP after all.\nThe Delphic oracle did it. Nostradamus did it. Hell, you can call fortunetellers over the phone nowadays to hear about the future. History is riddled with people claiming to know the future. Some have visions that come and go, others have foretelling dreams. There are those who seek the future by means of ritual, and then there are people who are struck with precognition randomly. You might have experienced it yourself. Ever thought of a friend and they called you (or in this modern age – they Facebooked you) seconds later? Is that an example of precognition or just coincidence?\nNostradamus had a number of prophecies that, when interpreted in a certain manner, predicted the Great Fire of London and the rise of Adolf Hitler (among others). However, Nostradamus was purposefully vague and cryptic in each of his predictions, leaving them open for interpretation. To say that he unmistakably foresaw those events in history would be a bit of a stretch. Still, among all the items on this list, the ability to see the future is the most abundant bizarre trait people believe they possess."}

{"text": "Freezing rain is falling, but that hasn’t stopped nearly 60 college students from strolling and steering their way to the Newman Center on the University of Maine campus in Orono. They’ve together to enjoy each other’s company as well as one of the center’s Wednesday Night Suppers, a free meal offered to anyone who stops by.\nThe suppers are just one of the many ways the Newman Center seeks to support and build a Catholic community on campus. There are also other social events, Masses followed by meals on Sunday evenings, Bible study groups, guidance from FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students) missionaries, eucharistic adoration, and service opportunities.\n“It’s a great place where I have found my best friends,” says Jake Gebhart, a junior and president of the student club Black Bear Catholic. “When you’re with a group of people who want you to grow in your faith, and are pushing you to be a better person, and are growing in your faith with you, you’re going to thrive.”\n“It was very important that there was a Newman Center or a Catholic center close by when I was searching for colleges because I didn’t want to feel like faith was just something that I was gripping onto; it was something I wanted to grow,” says Katie Dube, a junior and vice president of Black Bear Catholic. “I’ve definitely been able to do that here.”\n“I consider this place my third home. I have my home back in Arundel, and then I have the place where I live here, and then this place,” says Jacob Buttarazzi, a junior.\nSince the first Newman Club was established on campus in 1946, tens of thousands of students from across Maine and beyond have found a sense of belonging there. Students first gathered in a home, then in a chapel known as the “Log Cabin.” It remained in use until 1971, when the current Our Lady of Wisdom Newman Center began welcoming students.\nAt the time it was built, the center was touted for its innovative design, with a central courtyard, different roof heights, and numerous windows. Unfortunately, it proved not to be a match for Maine winters.\n“Climate-wise, this building was all wrong for Maine,” says Father Wilfred Labbe, pastor of the Parish of the Resurrection of the Lord, of which Our Lady of Wisdom is a part. “There is no insulation. It’s rotting. There are issues inside and outside the building with condensation. It was a beautiful building that was built in the wrong place.”\nAdditionally, the center only has a limited area for social events and what little room exists is not separate from the worship space. As a result, when those evening meals are held, tables spill over into the rear of the church.\n“It doesn’t meet our needs. We need a space for worship, a space that is sacred, but we also need space for social events and gatherings,” says Father Labbe.\nRealizing the necessity of preserving the center, as well as ensuring the vitality of the parish’s other three churches, the Parish of the Resurrection of the Lord launched, “Rebuild His Church,” a $3.5 million-dollar capital campaign.\n“This is the right time and the right thing to do,” says Father Labbe.\nThe restoration work that will be done includes repairing the buttresses at Holy Family Church in Old Town, which are showing the effects of more than 150 years of freezing and thawing.\n“I think one of the most beautiful churches in our diocese is Holy Family Church in Old Town, so to preserve that church is important,” says Father Labbe.\nThere will also be some interior painting at Holy Family, and the church’s parking lots and driveways may be repaved.\nAt St. Ann Church within Penobscot Nation, the tin ceiling will be restored, the chimney rebuilt, and the parking lot repaved.\n“The church on Indian Island has been there forever. It’s a historical building. I love that little church. We’re bringing it up to its proper condition,” says Father Labbe.\nAnd at St. Ann Church in Bradley, the focus will be on regrading the parking lot, which has poor drainage, resulting in ice buildup during the winter. The church will also have oil tanks replaced and roof work done.\n“The people there have taken very good care of their church, so again, it’s mainly cosmetic and not structural,” Father Labbe says.\nThe parish estimates that work at the three churches will cost approximately $1.3 million. The remaining $2.2 million will go to where the need is the greatest, the Newman Center. Renovations to it will be extensive and will include evening out the roofline, installing weather-resistant siding, putting in a commercial kitchen, and removing the center courtyard to create a new hall. The hall will be separated from the worship space, which will be raised so that it is all on one level, making it more accessible to those with mobility issues.\n“Right now, Masses takes place at the lowest point in the church rather than the highest point, so instead of your eyes being drawn up, they’re drawn down. The new design will change that,” explains Father Labbe.\nThe worship space will also be reconfigured to make it look more like a church than it currently does. Plans call for the installation of stained-glass windows from the former St. Ignatius Church in Sanford on the outside and the use of windows from the old “Log Cabin” on the inside.\n“We’ve done a great job here of building a community and making people feel at home. Now, we need to be a visible sign of not only being a home but being a Christian home, being a home where people who are searching for the truth can say, ‘Jesus is there, and there is truth,’” Father Labbe says. “It is so important for us to be able to be a witness in every possible way -- in word, in deed, in structure -- that this is an unchanging reality. This is where truth is. There is where you find love.”\nStudents who spend time at the Newman Center say they are excited about the possibilities.\n“I personally feel that if we had the resources to hold more people and the resources to help more people, we would be able to do just that. That’s why the improvements are important to me,” says Jacob.\n“There is that completely empty space in the middle that is never used. It looks kind of cool, but we could definitely use more space to maybe have a formal or some sort of dance, or to have more events and larger dinners,” says Jake.\nThe students emphasize the difference the Newman Center has made in their lives.\n“Coming into college, I had a sort of vague sense of faith. It wasn’t terribly important to me. I was also really struggling with a lot at the time, so freshman year was kind of rough for me. But the Newman Center provided a place that allowed me to learn more about my faith and helped me get a sense of purpose that I couldn’t find anywhere else,” says Jacob. “I noticed that the more involved I got, the better my life got, the happier I was as a person. So, I lead a men’s group now,” says Jacob.\n“I’ve been part of Bible studies. I’ve led Bible studies. I’ve had opportunities for leadership positions within our group here, and I’ve definitely, definitely grown. I really don’t know what I would do without this group of people or this community,” says Katie. “I’ve had friends who weren’t certain about faith at all, and I invited them to Bible study. While my friend isn’t Catholic, she is turning to the Christian faith and starting to ask some questions. I’ve been able to have some honest answers for her. We grab coffee. We talk here. It’s truly a wonderful place to be.”\nFather Labbe says it is impossible to underestimate the importance of having a Newman Center that is active and inviting.\n“I think young people are drawn to what is most attractive to them, and our competition -- worldliness, relativism -- they do a better job of presenting themselves as attractive than the Church does,” he says. “It’s estimated that up to 80% of students who show up on campus with faith, leave without it.”\nWhile launching a capital campaign isn’t easy, Father Labbe stresses its necessity.\n“Holy Family Church stands at the top of the hill, and when you’re driving through town, to look up and see that cross there and know that Jesus resides there, that is important. It is important on the tiny island of Penobscot Nation and in Bradley that these places exist and continue to be signs of hope. And it’s vitally important that the Newman Center be here. It is Jesus telling us go and do this mission, and to do otherwise would be denying our responsibility to do the work of Jesus,” Father Labbe says. “When you’re asking for money for something noble, and virtuous, and important in our pursuit of holiness and extraordinariness, then it’s not that hard. I have the grace of the Holy Spirit behind me. I know what I’m doing is for the greater glory of God.”\nHow you can help:\nFor more information, email Fr.

{"text": "European Western Balkans spoke to MEP Eduard Kukan, Chair of the Delegation to the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee. Kukan served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia from 1998 to 2006. He also was UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy for the Balkans.\nEuropean Western Balkans: After 60 years of the Rome Treaty a lot of things changed in the EU. How do you see the perspective of the European enlargement? Is it still possible?\nEduard Kukan: Yes, EU enlargement is an ongoing process, as can be seen by concrete advances in Montenegro and Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU success in 2016. The celebration of the Rome Treaty anniversary was a not only an opportunity to look back at the achievements of the integration process and it’s meaning for our continent, but also a way to look forward to the next decades. That is why I think it’s a pity the leaders of the Western Balkans were not invited to the celebration in Rome. It would have been a good and encouraging signal from our side.\nEuropean enlargement is still a big part of our common project, and support to it was also underlined in The Rome Declaration: “We want a Union which remains open to those European countries that respect our values and are committed to promoting them”. This resonated also at the EPP Congress in Malta earlier this year. These statements speak to the essence of the European perspective of Western Balkans: by a genuine dedication to the reform process and advancing in it, the EU is ready to welcome new members.\nEWB: How would you asses the current state of democracy in the Western Balkans?\nEK: We are seeing a worrying trend across the entire region, notably in relation to the regular functioning of parliamentary democracy and certain state institutions. It creates almost a vicious circle in which weak democracies fuel into weak institutions and the other way around.\nWe are facing serious political crises in Macedonia and Albania. Other countries in the region, for instance Montenegro and Kosovo, are struggling with parliamentary boycotts. This seems to be a regional trend, which is counter-productive to the democratic development in the countries at the European doorstep. I hope the upcoming months will see a significant reversal in this trend. It is, after all, the first Copenhagen criterion and the most fundamental one.\nEWB: What do you see as the main benefits for Serbia in the accession to the EU?\nEK: Serbia joining the EU will be a fulfilment of its strategic orientation. Serbia is a part of Europe and I believe it should be strongly anchored in the European Union as well. The benefits of EU membership are peace, stability, democratic rule of law, and the benefits of an integrated market. That translates also into a strong economy which follows rules. Being inside the club is always better, because you can participate on the decision-making process. Being on the outside of the European Union means you only observe the consequences of the decisions of the continent, and you have no active say in them. So for me, the choice is clear and I hope the same applies to Serbia.\nEWB: As the chair of the Delegation to the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee, how would you assess the progress of Serbia in the negotiations?\nEK: Serbia is steadily progressing in the negotiations, which is proved by the latest opening and provisional closing of chapters in February 2017. The accession process takes time and cannot be rushed, and I think we should sometimes be reminded of it. My own country negotiated for over 8 years.\nSerbia needs to continue to show that EU accession is a goal for the country, while playing a positive role in the region. I think that Serbia is performing well and I encourage the Maltese Presidency and the subsequent Presidencies to aim at opening, and eventually also closing negotiating chapters.\nEWB: Serbian CSO are concerned about media freedom and human rights in the country, beside the fact that Serbia is making progress in the accession talks. What are your thoughts about this issue?\nEK: We observe the situation in Serbia and take the concerns of the civil sector seriously. Respecting the rule of law and fundamental freedoms is a prerequisite for any modern and democratic European country. And once again, it is the first Copenhagen criterion. Without it, there is no EU accession.\nCSOs are not enemies of the state. They also aren’t the opposition to the government. They are there to reflect the feedback of the society on the state of play of affairs in the country. The state institutions should cooperate with them and listen to their concerns."}

{"text": "For 13-year-old Coral Fairchild, Snapchat trumps old-style text messaging as the way to socialize with friends in the mobile Internet age.\nThe northern California girl adds mustaches to faces in pictures or speech bubbles using touch-screen features that allow people to draw on Snapchat images being sent.\n\"You can take a regular selfie and customize it into a princess or a unicorn or whatever you want,\" she explained. \"It's just a more fun way to communicate.\"\nBut if the message turns out to be too embarrassing, no problem. It will disappear in seconds.\nThe Southern California-based service has gained notoriety for the app that lets people send smartphone photos or video snippets timed to self-destruct 10 seconds or less after being opened.\nSnapchat has rocketed to popularity since the initial app was released in September of 2011. Its growth initially sparked fears that, in a world of selfies, it would provide a false sense of security for teenagers thinking of sexting risque photos.\nThat concern appears unfounded, according to Matthew Johnson, director of education at Canadian not-for-profit digital literacy organization MediaSmarts.\n\"There is no evidence that Snapchat is being used any more recklessly than any other message service,\" Johnson said.\n\"Young people expect their friends and peers to do the right thing and rely on social pressure when it goes wrong,\" he continued, citing research done by MediaSmarts.\n\"In general, their instincts are very good, and they have in many ways a better handle on the social and emotional aspects of these technologies than we tend to think.\"\nConversations based on ephemeral images also reduce the potential for misunderstanding by providing expressions and other visual cues absent in email or basic text messages, according to Johnson.\n\"Many adults can relate to reading an email and not knowing whether the person who sent it was being angry or sarcastic,\" he said.\n\"Move that to text messaging where there is a limit to the number of characters you can use and the back-and-forth is faster, and there is always the possibility of something exploding because someone misunderstands something.\"\nAlong with providing pictures, typically selfies showing expressions, the mere fact someone is using Snapchat usually sends a signal that they are being playful and not serious, according to Johnson.\n\"Snapchat is essentially one big Smiley,\" he said, referring to a well-known happy-face emoticon.\nThe startup made news when the Wall Street Journal reported it rejected a $3 billion offer from Facebook, presumably because its founders believed it would be worth more than that.\nAnd other reports said Snapchat delivers some 400 million photos or videos daily from users, although the number is believed to count each time a recipient opens a file, possibly counting some messages more than once.\nSnapchat skews young due to the fact it is aimed at people who prefer messaging from mobile gadgets.\nSnapchat chief Evan Spiegel was recently quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that 70 percent of Snapchat users are women.\nThe company's in-house sociology researcher, Nathan Jurgenson, sees the service as a natural place for pictures that won't return to haunt people.\n\"It's easy to underestimate the significance of injecting more ephemerality into social media,\" Jurgenson said in a blog post.\n\"Part of the Snapchat appeal is that it serves as a social cue that something shouldn't be saved, not that it can't,\" he said.\n\"Young people say they will use it for something silly or a little embarrassing that they still want to share just with friends.\"\nJurgenson said the fact that the messages are timed to destruct means people will give them more attention: \"When you look fast, you look hard.\"\nSnapchat recently added a \"Stories\" feature that strings together a series of \"snaps\" to create a narrative that is available for repeated viewing by recipients for 24 hours.\nBut even with though the messages disappear, it is quite easy to copy Snapchat messages or pictures before they vanish, and research shows that young people are aware of that, according to Johnson.\nJohnson expected the merging of pictures and text to become the new standard in messaging, while Coral Fairchild portrayed Snapchat as the \"great next step\" in mobile communications.\n\"I don't Snapchat anyone I don't know; that would be weird,\" Coral Fairchild said, noting she would make an exception for Harry Styles of mega-popular boy band One Direction.\n\"He wouldn't get my ugly faces, unless we were best friends.\"\nExplore further: Snapchat rejected $3 bn offer from Facebook"}

So, what next?\nWell, before we can do much with Git, we need to make sure we have at least a token familiarity with using the Bash command prompt. To do this, we will walk through some basic commands related to navigating in bash, getting information about the file system and environment, and working with directories and files. All of these are necessary in order to work with Git using the Bash command line.\nSince these posts can get long (due in large part to the large number of screen shots), this may span a few posts. It’s not as bad as it looks, really. Lots of pictures.\nIf you are already familiar with the concepts here, and mainly just need help with the proper syntax for performing these actions in Bash, refer to my Basic Git Command Line Reference Post which contains a listing of the most common git and Bash commands without all the narrative.\nOtherwise, read on, and let’s get comfortable using the Bash command line in a Windows environment.\nGet Acquainted with Bash\nThe Bash command line comes from a Unix heritage, and even if you are familiar with the Windows command line, or Powershell, using Bash is different.\nFirst, we should get a little comfortable moving around our file system and performing basic tasks with files and directories.\nWhen you first open the Bash command window, you should see something like this:\nIn the above, the text in green is the User Name and Computer Name, displayed using the convention UserName@ComputerName. The curlicue character following means that we are in our default directory (or folder), usually our Windows User Folder.\nA line which begins with the default prompt (in this case, a $ symbol) is a line on which you will enter a command. Lines without the $ symbol will represent feedback from the system. Each time you type in a command and hit enter, Bash will execute the command, return whatever output (if any) and the leave you with a new prompt.\nNote that many commands simply execute, and there is no output. It is a principle amongst Linux programming that a good program executes silently, and only provides feedback if requested, or if something has gone wrong. More on this momentarily.\nList the Directories within the Current Folder\nWe can list other directories within our current folder using the ls command. Type ls into your Bash window and hit enter:\nUse Bash to list the contents of the current directory:\nHuh. That’s a lot of stuff, and except for those items with file extensions, it is hard to tell what is a directory (folder) and what is a file of some sort. Wouldn’t it be nice to show just the folders, without the other stuff?\nIn a clear case of stating the obvious, the following will clear your Bash window. Type this and hit enter:\nClear the Bash window:\nNow, let’s try to examine the folders in our current directory again, and see if we can get a more useful view of the subfolders we are working with. Type the following command into the Bash window, and hit enter again:\nPrint a listing of all directories within the current directory:\n$ ls -d */\nThe result should look like this:\nThat’s a little more like it. Ok, so now we can see what folders exist within our current directory.\nFor a cleaner listing of the variations for the ls command, see the Show Directory Contents section of my Basic Git Command Line Reference Post.\nCreate a New Directory in the Current Directory\nNext, let’s create a new folder. The command for creating a new directory is as follows:\nCreate a new directory within the current directory:\n$ mkdir NewFolderName\nType that into your Bash window, substituting MyNewFolder for NewFolderName and hit enter. This is what you should see when you are done:\nBut hey - nothing happened, right? Wrong.\nAs mentioned above, when the mkdir command executed properly, the result is “silence.” In other words, Bash assumes YOU know that, lacking additional feedback, everything went fine. Let’s check and see. Type your new “Show me all the folders, but only the folders” command we discussed previously, and hit enter:\nWell, what do you know. There is our new folder. But wait. What if we want spaces in the name of our folder? Let’s try THAT with a another new folder. Type the following and hit enter:\nCreate a folder named My Other New Folder:\n$ mkdir My Other New Folder\nWhen you hit enter, you should see something like this:\nHey, looks like everything worked! No complaints from Bash. Let’s see, using our “Show directory contents” command again:\nUh-oh. Looks like things didn’t go quite the way we expected. As it turns out, we confused Bash, because the actual syntax of the mkdir command is:\nThe full syntax for the mkdir command:\n$ mkdir Folder_1 Folder_2 . . . Folder_n\nSo when we typed in a folder name containing spaces, Bash thought we were creating a separate new folder for each word. As it turns out, most of the time when using Bash, we need to enclose text with spaces in quotes, so that Bash will know that the quoted text represents a single object or idea. Let’s try creating our new folder with spaces in the name again. This time, type the following into the Bash window:\nCreate a new folder with spaces in the name:\n$ mkdir \"My Other New Folder\"\nWhen you are done, you should see something like this:\nAgain, we assume that nothing went wrong from a technical standpoint, because Bash executed the command and returned without complaint. If we check to see again, we find the following:\nYay! So now we can not only create folders, but with spaces in the names too, dammit!\nFor more on creating directories, see the Creating New Directories Section in my Basic Git Command Line Reference Post\nMove to a Folder Within the Current Directory\nOk, so now let’s navigate ourselves into the first folder we created, MyNewFolder. First, though, let’s clear the bash window again, so we can get rid of all the clutter we have accumulated so far.\nWhen we want to move to a new location using Bash, we use the cd command:\nThe correct syntax for this command is:\nChange Directory Command Syntax:\n$ cd [options] [<DirectoryName>]\nIn the above, the square brackets denote optional inputs, and the angle brackets denote user-supplied values. In both cases, we do not type the actual brackets into the command window.\nSince Bash already knows the current directory we are in, we can specify a folder name which exists in the current directory, without the rest of the directory path. Type the following into the Bash window, and hit enter. You should see something similar to this:\nNote in the above that the line above our prompt has changed, and appears to indicate our current path as:\nRemember that Bash uses the ~ symbol to denote our default (User) directory, so this is a relative reference within the user directory. From where we are right now, there are a number of ways we could return to the user directory.\nThe first is to simply enter the cd command with no additional input. Doing this will return us to the default directory from wherever we happen to be in the file system:\nReturn to the Default Directory (“Take Me Home”)\nAnother option is to type cd - (that’s the cd command followed by a space, followed by a single dash). This tells bash to go back to the previous directory. In this particular case, the previous directory also happens to be our home user folder, but it really doesn’t matter what directory we came here from, cd - returns us there.\nReturn to the Previous Directory (“Take Me Back”)\n$ cd -\nThe third option is to type cd .. (that is the cd command, followed by a space, followed by two periods in a row). This command tells bash to go up one level in the folder hierarchy.\nMove Up One Level (“Take Me Up”)\n$ cd ..\nConsidering that we are currently in a folder within our home directory, you can see why in the current situation, these three are all about the same in terms of returning to the home directory. At the moment, it is not only the last place we navigated from, but is also one level above our current location. And it is, indeed the home folder. So all three options work for us in this case. Try the “Take Me Up” command. Type it into your Bash window and hit enter. You should see something like this:\nNote that we now appear to back in the “directory known as ~” or, our user folder.\nNow type the “Take Me Back” Command (cd -) and hit enter:\nNow, here we are right back in the MyNewFolder directory. Note that Bash decided to tell us where it took us in long form:\nA Linux-Style Directory Path\nBut wait - what is with that funny directory syntax? That is the Linux directory style. In fact, when typing explicit directory paths into Bash, you will need to use that format, because Bash will not recognize the Windows directory style. It’s easy enough to follow though:\n- Instead of using the forward-slash (\\) character as a path delimiter, Bash (and Linux) uses the backslash (/)\n- /c/ is the Linux way of expressing the familiar C:\\\nMove to a Specific Directory Using the Complete Directory Path\nKnowing this, we can also use explicit paths for navigation. For example, let’s say I wish to move from the current directory to my Documents folder. I can type the following:\nMove to a specific directory using the directory path:\n$ cd /c/Users/CurrentUserFolder/Documents\nTry that now, substituting your user folder, assuming that you have a standard Windows file structure, which includes a Documents folder in your user folder by default:\nOk. If all went well, you should now find yourself in your Documents folder. Note that even though you are within a subfolder of your user folder, Bash is now displaying the long form of the directory path, instead of the shorthand relative path.\nNow try using the “Take Me Home” version of the cd command (simply type cd and hit enter):\nPresto - back in our home directory.\nFor more on directory navigation, see the Navigating the File System Section of my Basic Git Command Line Reference Post\nOk, now what about those folders we “accidentally” created when we entered a multi-part directory name? You know, the folders named “My” and “Other” and “New” and “Folder”? Remember THIS:\nSince these folders are all empty, we can simply use the rmdir command:\nRemove One or More Empty Directories:\n$ rmdir Directory_1 Directory_2 . . . Directory_n\nType the rmdir command as follows and hit enter. When you are done, you should see something like this:\nThen, if we check the directory contents again, we see that those extra directories no longer exist:\nRemoving an empty directory or directories is a simple undertaking. The process is a little different if the directory to be removed contains files or other directories. We’ll look at this in the next post.\nNext: Creating and Working with Files using Bash\nJohn on Google"}
{"text": "Historic tile, contemporary style\nOn the central grounds of the University of Virginia, at the heart of Thomas Jefferson's Academical Village, renovation and reuse have been ongoing since the statesman laid the foundation for the first of 10 pavilions in 1817.\n\"Architecture is my delight,\" wrote Jefferson, \"and putting up and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.\" Some of Jefferson's ideology never goes away. Amid an evolutionary, never-ending construction and renovation program, the historical buildings remain an occupied, integral part of university life almost 200 years after their construction.\nAt the north end of \"the Lawn,\" facing the 10 pavilions connected by student dormitory rooms and looking out over the Blue Ridge Mountains, Jefferson's brick and marble, half-scaled version of Rome's Pantheon, \"the Rotunda,\" was erected as the focal point of academic life at the school. Despite its destruction by fire in 1903, its resurrection that same year by the renowned New York architectural firm McKim Meade and White — and subsequent work to restore the Jeffersonian interiors lost in that firm's interpretation — the Rotunda remains today an active epicenter.\nSometime around 1939, a terraced walkway was constructed that encircled the Rotunda and connected its north and south porticoes. Railed with a white marble balustrade and topped with slate-grey stone, the new walkways became defining features and the paths most often traveled by visitors.\nTruth be told, there is no record to indicate that Jefferson ever foresaw the use of a walkway like this at the Rotunda. The composition was thoroughly Jeffersonian, however, and a similar walkway exists at Monticello, Jefferson's home just a few miles away. The original design for the Rotunda did boast a long, thin \"Gymnasium\" on the south side, tucked neatly below the monumental staircase that meets the lawn.\nThe walkway itself was the focus of a face-lift in 1983. Pavers were pulled up and reinstalled, but the original marble balustrade was never removed. Within 10 years, however, it was clear to everyone that there were problems underfoot. Water was entering the structure from the walkway, and finding its own path through the gymnasium to the offices beyond, says James Murray Howard, curator and architect of The Academical Village. One such office, ironically, belonged to the very architect of the university.\nHoward employed local architect Michael D. Stoneking, a principal with Stoneking/von Storch Architects, to help him investigate and repair the problem. Stoneking, in turn, brought in an investigative team of material scientists from the Washington, D.C., office of the Chicago E/A firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates (WJE) to find out where the water might be entering the structure. After first focusing on the terrace's field of greyish bluestone pavers, Matt Farmer, project manager from WJE, and his team turned their attention to the balustrade.\nUpon its careful removal, it was discovered that the balustrade and associated cornice were set without the metal flashing being locked together, says Howard. \"They were lapped, but not folded or locked together. Slow seepage of water from the terraces, which became greater over the years, produced chronic spalling of the plasterwork below.\" Stoneking adds that the balustrade and flashing were not part of the 1983 project. \"This was an original condition,\" he explains.\nThe project team had its answer, and defined its methodology to resolve the problem. Charlottesville general contractor Martin-Horn Inc. disassembled the marble balustrade and cornice and cleaned it with natural bristle brushes and hot water; the old underlayment was removed, and the structural slab reinforced. New stainless-steel flashing was installed and properly locked, and a rubberized, monolithic asphalt membrane was installed for the new underlayment. WJE had previously used this material to resolve a similar condition at Washington, D.C.'s Kennedy Center, and recommended it for use at the Rotunda, as well.\nFor rebuilding the terraced walkway, Howard and Stoneking selected a dark grey Virginia granite with a roughened \"thermal\" surface texture. The team felt that the granite would hold up better over time, under the feet of the thousands of students and tourists that make daily use of the Rotunda and the famous lawn.\nThe project team completed 25 percent of the terraced walkway last summer, with plans to complete the lawn-side surfaces later this year. \"This hasn't been a terribly complicated project, just a lot of hard work,\" says Everett Collins, Martin-Horn's project superintendent. \"The only real challenge is the timing.\" As with most projects involving academic buildings, the University of Virginia tries to limit work to the summer months, between spring commencement and fall orientation.\nDuring the selective demolition, Collins discovered two coins in the rubble, a penny from 1879, and a two-cent piece dated 1865, that sat under the corner of one of the massive portico columns. \"Someone left me a message,\" Collins adds, noting that he plans to replace the coins by placing a gold dollar, circa 2000, in the same location, when a specially ordered piece of base marble arrives.\nPorcelain lands at airport\nThe contemporary use of stone is not limited to the austerity of academia, nor the buttoned-up architecture of antiquity. In fact, recent projects for public areas have increasingly relied upon stone and tile to lend a lasting, weighty quality to their civic image. While much of the stonework has appeared in the hallowed halls of government and justice facilities, pavers, marble and granite tile are used more often on plazas, entrance areas and lobbies. Inside, terrazzo, brick and ceramic and porcelain tile add a lasting quality and sense of value.\nYet, the materials are increasingly specified for the most utilitarian of spaces as well, where acoustics and first-cost concerns may have once ruled out the use of stone. At the Sarasota-Bradenton (Fla.) International Airport, for example, Tampa-based interior design firm Kelly Taaffe Design Inc. created a new mosaic mural floor for the terminal building, covering more than 52,000 square feet of the airport's 240,000-sq.-ft. floor space with decorative stone tile.\n\"We wanted to be creative, yet needed durability and easy maintenance,\" says Kelly Taaffe, the firm's principal and the project designer. In the passenger terminal, which opened in 1989, Taaffe's intent was to use flooring as a tool to introduce travelers to the best of what Florida has to offer, namely the sun, the beach and aquatic wildlife.\nTaaffe selected commercial-grade porcelain stone tile for her floor murals, which she notes \"gave us unlimited design possibilities.\" The owner, Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority , supported the choice both because of its aesthetic possibilities and its 30-year life and warranty. The designer and owner compared the choice with carpet and vinyl composition tile, or VCT, in terms of lifespan, warranty, ease of maintenance — and acoustics. The authority was initially concerned with terminal noise and the transference of noise from outside; traditionally, most airport public spaces rely on carpet and sound-absorbing underlayment.\nTo address this issue, says Taaffe, \"A noise-transference layer was installed between the substrate and the tile to help with acoustics.\" The designer then worked closely with Intercoastal Distributors, the tile manufacturer's local representative, and with Carpet Services of Tampa, the flooring contractor, to create a tile installation with an average grout joint of less than 1/8 inch. \"This was a real challenge, considering the amount of floor space and the condition of the existing slab,\" notes Doug Mahoney, project manager for the tile supplier.\nThe result is an installation that exceeds industry standards for lippage — defined as places where tile edges are exposed, or have lips — and contributes to both the aesthetic and sound-absorption qualities the airport authority was seeking. Today, as travelers to southwestern Florida arrive and depart, they are treated to a floor design that is as pleasing to the ears as it is to the eyes."}

{"text": "Monday, 11 October 2010\nI've recently completed an audiobook recording of the Mysterious Forces of Civilization by 'Abdu'l-Bahá. The Mysterious Forces of Civilization (Persian: Risálih-i-Madaníyyih) is a work written before 1875 by ‘Abbás Effendí, known as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (the Servant of Bahá) (1844-1921). The Persian text was first lithographed in Bombay in 1882 and printed in Cairo in 1911. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the eldest son and appointed successor of Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith. The original text of this work was written and published anonymously, and the first English translation (by Johanna Dawud) was published in London in 1910 and Chicago in 1918, under the title ‘Mysterious Forces of Civilization’ written by \"an Eminent Bahai Philosopher.\" This audiobook is based on the 1918 edition. Another translation was completed by Marzieh Gail and published in 1957, with an introduction by Horace Holley. The title was re-translated as “The Secret of Divine Civilization”.\nThe book was widely known in its time as an attempt to improve the degraded condition of Persia (Iran). The author frequently references current issues that were being debated, such as whether to modernize and accept Western technology, or to reject Western culture and rely on technology developed in Persia and the Islamic world.\nThere are many public domain Bahá’í texts available online (including scanned pdfs at Internet Archive). Others can be found at Bahá’í Library Online and H-Net Baha'i (both in English/French and Arabic/Persian). In general, works are in the public domain (in the US) if they were published before 1923. Only works which are public domain in the United States can be recorded for LibriVox, because files are stored in the Internet Archive, which is based in the US. More books (published after 1923) will apparently enter the public domain in the Holy Year 2019, thus increasing the number of potential Bahá’í audiobooks that could be recorded for LibriVox.\nNevertheless, many great Bahá’í books were published before 1923 and I look forward to seeing many more of them available as public domain audiobooks. It would be great to see more Bahá’ís involved in LibriVox and other projects to make free public domain Bahá’í audiobooks, so that the teachings may become more widely available in an audio format, for the benefit of all the waiting masses that shall enter into the Faith \"by troops\" (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, v. 270, p. 135).\nMonday, 4 October 2010\nI've recently completed my recording of Paris Talks (a.k.a. Talks by Abdul Baha Given in Paris) from an old, public domain edition available on Internet Archive (see here). Before recording, I divided it into 39 short sections, worked out the word counts, etc. and set it up as a solo project on the LibriVox forums. LibriVox is a volunteer initiative to record every book available in the public domain. As one can imagine, there are millions of books in the world (I'm not sure how many in the public domain), so LibriVox has a huge goal. Nevertheless, over 3,000 audiobooks have been produced so far, and each of these is free to download and listen to legally. In fact, since they're public domain, one could even sell the recordings on ebay (which actually does happen). A few of my audiobooks, including The Bahai Revelation and In Galilee by Thornton Chase, The Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons by Isabella D. Brittingham, Persian Self-Taught, Esperanto Self-Taught and others are currently being sold by ebay sellers not associated with me in any way. In a sense, though, that's the beauty of the public domain. It is free and universally available to all. If one wants to make a cd of a public domain book and sell it, one is free to do so. Knowledge must be universally accessible, and LibriVox is a part of the initiative to make it so.\nShoghi Effendi envisioned the internet age in the 1930's (\"A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity\", The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 203) and the Universal House of Justice envisions a convergence of information technologies (telephone, computer, etc.) into one universally accessible means of communication and distribution of knowledge (\"It is apparent that the decades immediately ahead will see the integration of telephone, television, and computer technologies into a single, unified system of communication and information, whose inexpensive appliances will be available on a mass scale\", 1999 Feb, Who is Writing the Future).\nBahá'u'lláh teaches that we must seek the truth. Indeed, the greatest oppression is to seek the truth and not know where to find it (\"\"What \"oppression\" is more grievous than that a soul seeking the truth, and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where to go for it and from whom to seek it?\" The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 30). The internet is helping us to overcome this oppression. Wikipedia, Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg and LibriVox are among the many projects, movements and initiatives led by volunteers to open up the entire realm of human knowledge and make it accessible to all and downloadable by all. With such tools, if one searches the world religions and their teachings, one cannot fail to find the Bahá'í Faith. If one has an open mind, frees oneself from prejudice and past superstitions and purifies oneself (as described in The Kitab-i-Iqan Book of Certitude), one cannot fail to recognise its truth. The internet is thus one of the great means for conducting a search after truth and true salvation.\nLibriVox is a tremendous way of producing public domain, freely accessible Bahá'í literature. One needs only find a public domain Bahá'í text (and there are many at Internet Archive, Google Books, H-Net, etc.), create an account at the LibriVox forum, read the Newbie Guide to Recording, submit a 1-minute test (to check one's settings are correct) and then one can begin to bring the world of Bahá'í literature to life in an audio format, so that the waiting masses of humanity can hear and appreciate the Word of God and the Divine Teachings. This is a great service to the Faith, that any Bahá'í can do. It's easy, it's fun, it's worthwhile and everyone can do it. You don't need to have the vocal chords of Patrick Stewart. Anyone can be a great audiobook reader. And the Bahá'í presence at LibriVox needs to increase many-fold.\nIn addition to public domain English texts, there is a huge possibility to record original works of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the original Persian and Arabic texts of which would now be public domain. Indeed, this is a great service which Arabic and Persian speaking Bahá'ís could do, by producing easily accessible, free versions of the Bahá'í writings in their original languages through LibriVox! :)\nMy recording of Talks by Abdul Baha Given in Paris is 6 hours, 26 minutes, 34 seconds in length and can be downloaded either from the LibriVox catalogue page or from the Internet Archive page. Internet Archive hosts all of LibriVox's finished recordings. It was catalogued on the 28th of September 2010 and, as of the 4th of October 2010, it has already been downloaded 120 times. I hope you enjoy it. If you like this recording, you will also like my recordings of:\nThe Bahai Revelation by Thornton Chase (already download 1,715 times)\nIn Galilee by Thornton Chase (already downloaded 395 times)\nThe Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons by Isabella D.

{"text": "· Read in 6mins · 1297 words ·\nThe Artificial Intelligence we believe to be global, is far from it. It is localised. Contained. Within restricted geographies and people. As the pressure of containment builds and the kettle begins to whistle, the call sounds. How do we make global AI truly global?\nThis call will be made in different ways. Inevitably, a call will be made to decolonise artificial intelligence. We understand why. Because, as much as we aspire towards an ideal scientific-self—the scientist that is forward-looking, sceptical and inclusive—we often fall far from this ideal. At times, we replay a colonial-looking world view. We rely on inherited thinking and sets of unquestioned values; we reinforce selective histories; we fail to consider our technology's impacts and the possibility of alternative paths; we consider our work to be universally beneficial, needed and welcomed.\nAnd so the call sounds. #Decolonise. Decolonise our Minds. Decolonise Science. Decolonise All the Things. This is the call that resonates today, loudly; louder than it ever has.\nThe call for decolonisation in artificial intelligence[note]Decolonising AI at the Leverhulme Centre for future of intelligence.[/note] [note]Video: Decolonising Artificial Intelligence? by Professor Genevieve Bell[/note] is yet to reach its full volume. It is a topic that I suspect is on the horizon, and one we will need to engage with. I am conflicted by a view that considers decolonisation as irrelevant to the challenges of developing human-centred artificial intelligence (AI), versus decolonisation as the critical thinking with which we shape a self-reflective and responsible community of AI designers. This essay is a reflection on my conflict, perhaps yours.\nDecolonisation emphasises self-ownership. For land and peoples and nations, it emphasises the restoration of 'land and life' to its original inheritors. Self-ownership, as Fanon says[note]Frantz Fanon, The wretched of the earth, 1963 [/note], is a 'precondition for the creation of new forms of life'. To create new ways of living and being, we need self-ownership.\nFor knowledge, decolonisation emphasises the restoration of self-confidence. We need self-confidence to create new thought and ways of thinking.\nThere are three views of decolonisation that give me a more concrete understanding[note]J. Jansen, As by Fire: The end of the South African University, 2017[/note].\nAs a de-centring of European knowledge. One can remove the colonial power, back to England or to France, but their legacies of thinking, psychology, economics, and culture remain. Decolonisation asks us remove Europe—or the 'west' more generally—as a point of reference. We should reject an imitation of the West in our scientific work. We should assert our own identities. We should re-centre our knowledge on approaches that restores our global histories and problems and solutions. For Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, this meant rejecting the English language as the unassailable medium of teaching and discourse. For we technologists, this could be re-centring our motivations, not always on the problems of silicon valley, but on our own localities and questions and backgrounds.\nTowards additive and inclusive knowledge. To remain globally competitive, and to address our key intellectual and social challenges, this form of decolonisation asks us to work together to use existing knowledge, but to explicitly recognise the value of new and alternative approaches. We should include other histories, like the ongoing correction of history that includes the Asian and African contributions to science[note]Clapperton Mavhunga, What Do Science, Technology, and Innovation Mean from Africa?

And we should support environments in which new ways of creating knowledge can flourish. What we must not do is include, and then relegate new voices to the periphery. Of relevance here is the open-source, open-access and open data movements in which we are already active participants.\nEngaging settled knowledge. We are asked to empower each other to take a critical view, always. Where does our knowledge come from? What does it include and leave out? Whose interests does it support? What are the assumptions by which our thinking is governed? What and who is silenced? This is the view that seems most relevant to our practice. Here, we are already engaged in areas of fairness, accountability, transparency, safety, robustness, verification and governance.\nAI will result in objects of culture, and its use will have impacts on the way our societies work (it already has). And this is why we should consider decolonisation seriously. But we are already engaged in these issues, under different headings and, importantly, in relation to their underlying technical questions. This brings the utility of decolonisation as a tool into question.\nNot a Metaphor\nThe famous paper by Tuck and Yang entitled 'decolonisation is not a metaphor'[note]Tuck E, Yang KW. Decolonization is not a metaphor. Decolonization: Indigeneity, education & society. 2012 Sep 8;1(1).[/note] enters:\n'Decolonisation brings about repatriation of indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools.E. Tuck and K. Wang, Decolonization is not a Metaphor, 2012.\nThis is an important clarification. The key message they leave us with, is that it is problematic to use decolonisation as a placeholder for all the ways we wish to engage with social justice. It leads to a loss of meaning.\nToo often is decolonisation used for political symbolism. Too often are claims for decolonisation used to raise opposition, without genuine concerns. Too often is decolonisation used to signal an enemy. Our science will not be advanced through a world-view based on empty symbolism and opposition: together we can move beyond the too-easy narrative of them-vs-us, coloniser-vs-colonised, metropole-vs-south, west-vs-rest.\nMore worryingly, decolonisation increasingly seems to be used as a replacement for Transformation. The price of transformation cannot be paid by allowing ourselves to be distracted by the language of decolonisation and delaying the work of deep social, institutional and personal responsibility for change.\nWe can learn from the questions that decolonisation raises and the strategies it suggests. But we can also maintain our focus on the important questions of social justice. I will continue to demand for a simpler language. Let us say what we mean and want, to aim to be understood, to be more precise. And we can do this by keeping the challenges we identify and their scientific and technical basis in close proximity.\nLessons for Artificial Intelligence\nThere is a reason for concern! What else can we see when read in the New York Times[note]Kai Fu Lee, The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence, New York Times June 2017[/note] about one future path for our countries:\n\"Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software — China or the United States — to essentially become that country’s economic dependent.\"Kai Fu Lee, The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence, June 2017\nWe immediately recognise the colonial nature of this possible future. When Ian Hogarth writes of AI nationalism[note]Ian Hogarth, AI Nationalism, June 2018[/note], we recall the hubris and implications of the nations that sought Empire. We are not oblivious to the fact that a form of imperialism based on data[note]Data Colonialism: Critiquing Consent and Control in “Tech for Social Change”, Model View Culture, June 2016[/note]\nand its ownership is possible (if not underway). We do recognise a forming cyber-colonialism[note]The Dawn of cyber-colonialism, June 2014[/note] that expands as censorship increases and online freedoms are curtailed.\nThis is where decolonisation plays its role. The solutions that have been tried in the restoration of land and life in the post-colonial age, can be ours to learn from and reuse. The basis of this solution is in self-ownership and its protection.\nFortunately, as a field we have the basis of such protections already. We can continue to strengthen open-source software, open-data, and open-access science— publishing more, not less; we can further support accessible machine learning frameworks, and accessible scientific communication; and we can continue to find solutions to the challenges of fairness, privacy, safety, verification, and governance. And we can go further, by always challenging our settled assumptions and world-views as we expand the frontiers of our knowledge.\nThe only AI that empowers and works for the benefit of humanity is a truly global AI. Making global AI truly global will not be easy. We have heard the call.\nThis essay was written while listening to My Queen Is Ada Eastman from the Sons of Khemet.

{"text": "Railroads in Other Countries\nOther nations with important railway lines include Great Britain, whose well-integrated railroad system, built mostly with private capital, was amalgamated into four lines by the Railway Act of 1921; nationalized in 1948, the system was largely privatized again by 1995. In Canada, the promise of a transcontinental railroad was a major impetus to confederation (see Canadian Pacific Railway). Railroads in France date from 1827, and after the 1840s France had one of the largest railroad systems in Europe. In 1994 the Channel Tunnel between England and France opened for passenger service, using a high-speed rail link. The first German railroad, running from Nuremberg to Furth, began operation in 1835. Soon Germany had a well-developed system, and by the beginning of the 20th cent. a majority of its railroads were owned by the state. The entire system was under state control by 1922. The first monorail line began operation (1899) in Elberfeld-Barmen (now Wuppertal), Germany.\nIn most other European countries, railroads date from about the middle of the 19th cent. and came increasingly under government ownership and operation. In Russian and other countries of the former Soviet Union, railroad construction, also begun in the mid-19th cent., received a great stimulus following the 1917 revolution, when railroads were first extended into Siberia. British capital and U.S. engineering skill laid the basis for many of the railroads of South America. Railroads of historical importance include the Baghdad Railway, the Trans-Caspian RR, the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Transandine Railway, and the Trans-Siberian RR.\nSections in this article:\nMore on railroad Railroads in Other Countries from Infoplease:\nSee more Encyclopedia articles on: Technology: Terms and Concepts"}

{"text": "When you cover your blemishes, give yourself a sunless tan, or straighten your hair, chances are you use a product with a long list of ingredients. But are those ingredients safe? Headlines proclaiming the dangers of beauty products are often based on hype, so WebMD takes a look at the science. And we offer some alternatives for those who want to reduce their use of chemicals.\nSalon-based keratin hair treatments can deliver silky, smooth locks with no frizz. These treatments are often marketed as formaldehyde-free, but Oregon's OSHA found high concentrations of the chemical in more than half of samples. Long-term exposure to formaldehyde can cause cancer. Getting your hair straightened or \"smoothed\" once every few months will not put you over OSHA's exposure limits. But there could be a real risk to your stylist.\nConditioner can help you fight frizz by neutralizing the impact of static electricity. And while the results will only last until your next shampoo, a flat iron can get the kinks out of most naturally curly hair. Using a blow dryer is less effective than a flat iron for smoothing hair, but your stylist might show you a few good techniques, combined with safe hair products, to tame a frizzy look\nResearch connecting hair dye to cancer has had conflicting results. Some studies suggest that women are slightly more likely to get leukemia or lymphoma if they use permanent hair dyes, particularly darker colors. But other studies have found there is no increased risk. Most research looking at hair dye and breast cancer has found no link. There is also no evidence suggesting hair dye poses a threat during pregnancy, although some health care providers recommend waiting until the second trimester to be extra cautious.\nPlant-based hair dyes, including henna and vegetable dyes, can change hair color without harsh chemicals. But there are some drawbacks. Most won't result in a dramatic color change, and the results tend to fade sooner than with permanent dyes. A second option is to get highlights at a salon. A special cap or foil hair wrappers prevent the dye on your tresses from touching your scalp, so the chemicals aren't absorbed by your skin.\nColored or patterned lenses that don't correct your vision can help you change your look. But avoid any lenses that are sold without a prescription, often available at salons, costume shops, or online. Contact lenses require proper fitting, cleaning, and care, even for a short wearing. If you don't care for them properly, you run the risk of eye injuries or infections that can lead to vision loss.\nIf you feel Mother Nature gave you the wrong eye color, ask a licensed eye care professional about colored contact lenses. Even if you have sharp vision, you'll still need an eye exam. The doctor can write a prescription for you and show you how to take care of the lenses properly. Buy lenses from a prescription-only source. Follow the doctor's directions to avoid injuring your eyes.\nLatisse is a prescription drug that can temporarily give you long, flirty eyelashes. You daub the serum onto your upper lash line every day and wait about four months for results. You may love the lashes, but it's important to note a small risk of side effects, some permanent. The drug may darken the skin around your eyes or turn the colored part of your eyes (the irises) brown.\nFalse eyelashes or eyelash extensions can give you that long-lashed look without a prescription drug. But that doesn't mean they're risk-free. The adhesives can irritate the eyelids or cause an allergic reaction. And beware of permanent eyelash tints that promise thicker-looking lashes. They have been linked to serious injury, including blindness. No permanent dyes are FDA-approved for use on the lashes.\nHydroquinone is a skin lightener that is available by prescription or in a less potent strength over the counter. Dermatologists often recommend it for reducing age spots or dark patches known as melasma. Overuse of hydroquinone can cause skin discoloration. Animal studies have also linked the chemical to cancer, though the risk to humans is unclear. Scientists are currently studying hydroquinone's safety.\nLaser skin resurfacing uses a special type of laser to remove the top layer of skin. The procedure, which is done by a dermatologist, can minimize age spots and even out skin color without the long-term use of a chemical lightener. Drawbacks include the expense, pain, the downtime while your skin is healing, and a small risk of scarring or discoloration.\nNo matter what you've heard about the safety of tanning salons, here's what the research says: frequent use of tanning beds raises your risk of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. In addition, tanning beds mainly emit UVA rays, which contribute to premature aging – wrinkles and brown spots. Even if tanned skin looks good to you, tanned skin is actually damaged skin.\nIt's easy to fake a tan. Sunless tanning lotions typically contain DHA, a color additive that reacts with amino acids in the skin's surface to create a temporary \"tan.\" DHA is FDA-approved for external application, but not for use in commercial spray tanning booths. These booths may cause you to inhale some of the spray or get it in your eyes. Be sure to use sunscreen even when you have a sunless tan. It does not protect your skin.\nManicure products contain a wide range of chemicals, including formaldehyde, phthalates, acetone, or toluene. Their fumes may irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and respiratory tract. These reactions are more common in salon workers than in clients. Manicures and pedicures can also result in fungal or bacterial infections – particularly if equipment has not been sterilized properly.\nBefore having a manicure or pedicure, inspect the salon's cleanliness. Leave if you doubt the quality of the salon's sanitation or disinfection practices. Don't shave your legs before a pedicure, and avoid the nail salon if your skin is cut, nicked, or broken. If you're a salon worker, ensure that your salon obeys laws designed to protect workers' safety.\nPhthalates are chemicals used to make products more pliable. They're found in toys, food packaging, and some beauty products, including nail polish, shampoo, and soap. Two studies suggest phthalate exposure during pregnancy may lead to abnormal development in male infants, including low hormone levels and small genital size. But the FDA says there is not enough evidence to conclude that phthalates pose a health risk.\nIf you're concerned about phthalates, look for phthalate-free beauty products. You can check the ingredients for the term phthalate (dibutylphthalate, dimethylphthalate, diethylphthalate, etc.), butyl ester, or plasticizer. It's important to note that phthalates are also found in flooring, shower curtains, food packaging, and many other staples of modern life. But using phthalate-free cosmetics and skin-care products can reduce your overall exposure.\nParabens are the most common preservative found in cosmetics, including makeup, moisturizers, and hair care products. One study found parabens in breast tumors, but did not indicate that parabens actually caused the cancer. Other researchers have concluded it is \"implausible\" that the amount of parabens in cosmetics could lead to cancer.\nIf you're concerned about parabens, you can find paraben-free beauty products. Cosmetics tend to spoil without preservatives, but parabens aren't the only option. Some products use vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate) as preservatives.\nIf you're hanging onto your glittery disco-era eye shadow, toss it now. Preservatives in the makeup may break down over time, allowing bacteria to grow. Experts offer the following \"use by\" guidelines:\n- Foundation - one year\n- Blush/powder/shadow - two years\n- Lipstick - one year\n- Mascara - 3-4 months\nThrow out eye makeup immediately if you have an eye infection.\nMineral makeup contains fewer irritating fillers and preservatives than regular cosmetics. But it can still contain allergens, so people with sensitive skin should look for products with as few ingredients as possible. Although mineral makeup often has built-in sunscreen, like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, don't rely on this as your sole protection from the sun. It's best to use mineral makeup over your regular sunscreen.\nThe ingredients in sunscreen have been used for many decades and are considered safe. The real danger is choosing a sunscreen that is too weak. To protect against both UVA and UVB rays, choose a product labeled \"broad spectrum\" and choose SPF 30 or higher to reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:\n- Jupiterimages / Getty Images\n- Monalyn Gracia / Fancy\n- Jupiterimages / Getty Images\n- Getty Images\n- Jerónimo Alba\n- Oppenheim Bernhard / Stone\n- Carlos Davila / Photographer’s Choice\n- Tanya Constantine / Blend Images\n- Getty Images\n- Tom Merton / OJO Images\n- Oregon OSHA.\n- National Cancer Institute.\n- Consumer Report.\n- American Cancer Society.\n- Organization of Teratology Information Specialists.\n- American Pregnancy Association.\n- Nemours Foundation.\n- March of Dimes.\n- American Optometric Association.\n- PubMed Health.\n- Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.\n- Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology.\n- American Society for Dermatologic Surgery.\n- Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.\n- International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO.\n- The Lancet Oncology.\n- Cleveland Clinic Health.\n- The Skin Cancer Foundation.\n- Environmental Protection Agency.

{"text": "The witch-cult hypothesis is a discredited theory that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an attempt to suppress a pre-Christian, pagan religion that had survived the Christianisation of Europe. According to its proponents, this cult revolved around the worship of a Horned God of fertility whom the Christian persecutors referred to as the Devil, and participated in nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath in which they venerated this deity.\nThe theory was pioneered by German scholars Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone in the early nineteenth century, before being adopted by the French historian Jules Michelet, American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and American folklorist Charles Leland later in that century. However, the hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when adopted by the British Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books like The God of the Witches (1931) and in her contribution to the Encyclopædia Britannica. Although the \"Murrayite theory\" proved popular in the mid-twentieth century, it was never accepted by specialists in the history of the witch trials.\nThe academic consensus is that the witch-cult never existed and that the theory is therefore a pseudohistorical claim. Critics highlight that the theory rested on a misrepresentation of the evidence and an assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful and not distorted by coercion and torture, resulting in a fundamental misinterpretation of the trials and the actions of the accused. Specialists also noted that there was no evidence of a pagan witch-cult throughout the Middle Ages, and that therefore it could not be tied to the pre-Christian period.\nHowever, the witch-cult hypothesis influenced literature, being adapted into fictional forms in the work of authors like John Buchan and Robert Graves. It greatly affected the origins of Wicca, a contemporary Pagan new religious movement that emerged in mid-twentieth century Britain, claiming to be the survival of the pagan witch-cult. Since the 1960s, scholars like Carlo Ginzburg argued that elements of pagan religion influenced the Early Modern stereotypes of witchcraft, with scholars debating how this relates to the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis.\n- 1 Early modern precedents\n- 2 The early theory\n- 3 The impact of Margaret Murray\n- 4 Later writers\n- 5 See also\n- 6 References\nEarly modern precedents\nThe witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an organized effort by authorities in many countries to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to Christendom. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must be separated from the belief in witches, the evil eye, and other such phenomena, which are common features of folk belief worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized in a powerful but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt.\nThis idea of an organized witch-cult originates in the second half of the 15th century, notoriously expounded in the 1486 Malleus Maleficarum. In the following two centuries, witch trials usually included the charge of membership in a demonic conspiracy, gathering in sabbaths, and similar. It was only with the beginning Age of Enlightenment in the early 18th century, that the idea of an organized witch-cult was abandoned.\nEarly Modern testimonies of accused witches \"confirming\" the existence of a witch cult are considered doubtful. Norman Cohn has argued that they were determined largely by the expectations of the interrogators, partly under torture, and free association on the part of the accused, and reflect only popular imagination of the times. Carlo Ginzburg and Éva Pócs hold that some of these testimonies can still give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg discovered records of a group calling themselves benandanti, the \"good walkers\" who believed that they combat witches (streghe) by magical means. The benandanti were persecuted for heresy in the period of 1575 to 1675.\nThe early theory\nJarcke and Mone\nThroughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the crime. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti made the claim that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were then echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835, in which he claimed that the witch stereotypes reflected an amalgam of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later medieval views of heresy. Both would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.\nThe first modern scholar to advance the claim that the witch trials had been designed to wipe out an anti-Christian sect was the German Karl Ernst Jarcke, a professor of criminal law at the University of Berlin. In 1828 he edited the records of a seventeenth-century German witch trial for publication in a legal journal, and included the theory in his own comments. Jarcke suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian religion that survived Christianisation among the rural population, but that after being condemned as Satanism by the Church, it eventually degenerated into genuine Devil-worship and malevolence. At that point, the wider population came to reject it, resulting in the trials. This theory exonerated the Christian Church of blame by asserting that they had been acting on the wishes of the population, while at the same time not accepting the literal intervention of the Devil in human affairs which liberal rationalists disbelieved. In 1832, Felix Mendelssohn adopted similar ideas when composing his orchestral piece, Die Erste Walpurgisnacht, in which a group of pagan villagers pretend to be witches in order to scare away Christians intent on disrupting their Walpurgis Night festivities.\nJarcke's theories were adopted and altered by the German historian Franz Josef Mone in 1839. Then director of archives at Baden, he published his ideas in a paper in which he asserted that the pre-Christian religion which degenerated into Satanic witchcraft was not Germanic in origin, but had instead been practiced by slaves who had come in contact with the Greek cults of Hecate and Dionysus on the north coast of the Black Sea. According to Mone, these slaves adopted these cults and fused them with their own pagan faiths to form witchcraft, a religion that venerated a goat-like god, celebrated nocturnal orgies and practiced poisoning and malevolent magic. This horrified the free-born population both in the pagan period and the Christian era, eventually resulting in the witch trials. However, as English historian Norman Cohn asserted in 1975, \"neither of [Jarcke or Mone's] theories are convincing\", with neither being able to show any evidence of pre-Christian gods being worshiped in Early Modern Germany or being able to explain why there was no accounts of this witch-cult in between the Christianization and the trials themselves. Both Jarcke and Mone were politically conservative, and their depiction of the threatening witch-cult would have had parallels with the widespread conservative fear of secret societies as bringers of revolution and irreligion in early nineteenth-century Europe.\nMichelet, Gage, and Leland\nIn 1862, French historian Jules Michelet published La Sorcière (The Witch), in which he adapted the theory further. Michelet, who was a liberal and who despised both the Roman Catholic Church and absolute monarchies, claimed that the Witch Cult had been practiced by the peasants in opposition to Roman Catholicism, which was practiced by the upper classes. He claimed that the witches had been mostly women (he greatly admired the feminine gender, once claiming that it was the superior of the two), and that they had been great healers, whose knowledge was the basis of much of modern medicine. He believed that they worshiped the god Pan, who had become equated with the Christian figure of the Devil over time. When Michelet's La Sorciere was first published in France, it was, according to historian Ronald Hutton, \"greeted with silence from French literary critics, apparently because they recognized that it was not really history\".\nIn 1893, an American suffragist, Matilda Joslyn Gage, published Woman, Church and State, in which she claimed that in the prehistoric world, humanity had been matriarchal, worshiping a great Goddess, and that the witches of the witch cult had been pagan priestesses preserving this religion.\nIn 1897, the English scholar Karl Pearson, who was the professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London and an amateur historian and anthropologist, expanded on Michelet's theory. Pearson agreed with the theory of a prehistoric matriarchal society, and concurred with Gage that the witch-cult was a survival of it. Pearson theorized that during the Christian era, the religion became focused around a male deity, which was then equated with the Christian Devil. Pearson also made the claim that Joan of Arc had been one of the last few priestesses of the religion. He was, however, unlike Michelet or Gage, opposed to the group and to Goddess worship in general, believing that it was primitive and savage.\nCharles Leland was an American folklorist and occultist who traveled around Europe in the latter 19th century and was a supporter of Michelet's theories. In 1899 he published Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, which he claimed had been a sacred text for Italian witches. It made no mention of a horned god, but did mention a male deity known as Lucifer, as well as a female deity, the goddess Diana. Leland's work would provide much of the inspiration for the neopagan witchcraft religion of Stregheria.\nThe impact of Margaret Murray\nIn 1915, Margaret Murray was an Egyptologist who worked under Flinders Petrie at University College London. However, the outbreak of World War I had meant that many of their staff and students had abandoned scholarship to aid the British war effort, while archaeological excavation to Egypt had been rendered impossible. These events gave Murray more latitude in her studies, and she began to branch out and explore other interests. To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to Saint-Malo in France. However, after being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury, Somerset, where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of Aramathea. Pursuing this interest, she published the paper \"Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance\" in the journal Ancient Egypt, although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised by scholars like Jessie Weston for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence.\nReturning to London, she began to work on the concept of witchcraft. Her first published work on the subject was an article in the academic journal Folklore in 1917, which she followed with a second in 1920. Further articles on the subject appeared in the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Scottish Historical Review.\nThe Witch-Cult in Western Europe: 1921\nIn The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. She drew a division between what she termed \"Operative Witchcraft\", which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and \"Ritual Witchcraft\", by which she meant \"the ancient religion of Western Europe\", a fertility-based faith that she also termed \"the Dianic cult\". She claimed that the cult had \"very probably\" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a \"Mother Goddess\" but that \"at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female\". In her thesis, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, \"manifest and incarnate\", to whom the witches' offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.\nMembers joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called \"admission ceremonies\"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptized into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into covens containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the \"Devil\" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a \"Grand Master\". According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.\nDescribing this witch-cult as \"a joyous religion\", she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the \"General Meeting of all members of the religion\" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. Nocturnal rites that began at midnight, Murray claimed that these Esbats were \"primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious.\" At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity, renewing their \"vows of fidelity and obedience\" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they have conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted, ceremonies and fertility rites took place, and then ended with feasting and dancing.\nDeeming Ritual Witchcraft to be \"a fertility cult\", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood, the sacrifice of animals, the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers, and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility. She interpreted accounts of witches' shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of familiars were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into \"divining familiars\" used in divination and \"domestic familiars\" used in other magic rites.\nMurray asserted that paganism had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be \"practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community.\" She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarves, who continued to live in the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.\nLater historian Ronald Hutton commented that The Witch-Cult in Western Europe \"rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology\". He also noted that the book's tone was generally \"dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footned to a source, with lavish quotation.\" It was not a best seller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on \"Witchcraft\" for the Encyclopædia Britannica, and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1968.\nThe God of the Witches and The Divine King in England: 1933–54\nMurray followed this book with The God of the Witches in 1933; although similar in content, it was aimed at a mass market audience and published by the popular press Sampson Low. Whereas the tone in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe had been \"dry and academic, the second bubbles with enthusiasm\", as her language becomes \"emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology\"; in particular she refers repeatedly to the cult as \"the Old Religion\". In this work she \"cut out or toned down\" many of the claims of her previous book which would have painted the cult in a bad light, for instance regarding animal and child sacrifice, and also omitted any mention of sex.\nIn this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the Horned God, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic. She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, as well as the deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration.\nIn 1954, she published The Divine King in England, in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice. She also claimed that a number of important figures who died violent deaths, such as Archbishop Thomas Becket, were killed as a replacement for the king.\nAcademic reception: 1921–63\nUpon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including a number of significant scholars, albeit none of whom were not experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like Sir George Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently recanted doing so. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Pennethorpe Hughes in his 1952 book Witches. It was also adopted and championed by the archaeologist T.C. Lethbridge, marking his increasing estrangement from mainstream academia; in turn, Murray publicly defended his controversial theories regarding the chalk hill figures of Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Downs, Cambridgeshire. As a result, a commentator writing in 1962 could comment that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\", being widely accepted among \"educated people\".\nCanadian historian Elliot Rose suggested that the reason why Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer of [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\", including \"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. As Hilda Ellis Davidson noted; \"how refreshing and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.\"\nNevertheless, Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced at the time were largely critical. George L. Burr critically reviewed both of her initial books on the subject for the American Historical Review. In his review of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe he asserted that she was not acquainted with the \"careful general histories by modern scholars\" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts.\nOne of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books specialising in the archival material which rejected Murray's ideas. In 1938 Ewen launched a vociferous attack on Murray's scholarship, dismissing her theory as \"vapid balderdash\". Similarly, W.R. Halliday reviewed her work for the Folklore journal and exposed the flaws in her use of sources.\nIn his 1962 work A Razor for a Goat, Rose asserted that Murray's books on the witch-cult \"contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning.\" He accepted that her case \"could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it.\" Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he asserts that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises her for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. In addition to this, he challenged Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as \"a view grounded on ignorance alone\".\nSimpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics Murray's theories were permitted \"to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic.\" As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in the journal Folklore between Murray's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robins' in 1963. However, she also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown, Ruth Tongue, or Enid Porter, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folklore.\nMurray did not respond directly to the criticisms of his work, but did react to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting on religious prejudice.\nAcademic reception: 1963–present\nMurray's work came to be increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occuring during the 1970s. At this time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America – such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo – began to publish in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.\nIn his 1971 book Religion and the Decline of Magic, English historian Keith Thomas dismissed Murray's thesis when he asserted that scholarship on the Early Modern witch trials had established that there was \"very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult\". Although accepting that when she first published her ideas, they were \"the best alternative\" to the dominant \"rationalist\" view of witchcraft as \"total delusion\", he stated that her conclusions were \"almost totally groundless\" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point. In his 1975 book Europe's Inner Demons, English historian Norman Cohn commented on the \"extraordinary\" manner in which Murray's theory had come to \"exercise considerable influence\" within scholarship. Cohn was nevertheless highly critical; he asserted that Murray's \"knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent.\" Furthermore, he added that her ideas were \"firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould.\" That same year, the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade, writing in the History of Religions journal, described Murray's work as \"hopelessly inadequate\" and full of \"numberless and appalling errors\". He added that from the perspective of a historian of religion, \"her use of comparative materials and, in general, the methods of Religionswissenschaft have been unfortunate.\"\nIn 1994, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson devoted a paper in the Folklore journal to the subject of \"Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why?\". She noted that the Murrayite theory was \"based on deeply flawed methods and illogical arguments\" and that the discipline of folkloristics had been damaged by its association with Murray, who had been appointed President of the Folklore Society. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves.\nIn 1996, historian Diane Purkiss asserted that Murray's thesis was \"intrinsically improbable\" and that it \"commands little or no allegiance within the modern academy\". She nevertheless felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had committed \"ritual slaughter\" when setting up their own histories of witchcraft by condemning Murray's. In doing so, she identified a trend for them to contrast their own perceived methodologically sound and sceptical interpretations with Murray's \"feminised belief\" about the witch-cult, hence ignoring any theoretical considerations regarding the male-centric nature of their own perspectives.\nIn his 1999 book The Triumph of the Moon, Hutton asserted that Murray had treated her source material with \"reckless abandon\", in that she had taken \"vivid details of alleged witch practices\" from \"sources scattered across a great extent of space and time\" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Concurring with this assessment, historian Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander stated that \"Murray's use of sources in general is appalling\". They went on to assert that \"Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises.\" In his sociological study of the Early Modern witchcraft, Gary Jensen highlighted that Murray's work had been \"seriously challenged\" and that it did not take into account \"why it took so long for the heretic witch to be invented and targeted\", noting that had the Murrayite witch-cult been a reality, then it would have been persecuted throughout the Medieval and not just in the Early Modern period.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Heinrich Himmler organised a branch of the SS to undertake the largest survey of witch-hunt trial records in Europe ever taken, with the dual aim of using it as anti-Christian propaganda, to claim that the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous Völkisch Norse-Germanic nature religion, and as evidence for reconstructing that religion. This prompted Stuart Clark to dub the Nazi regime \"Europe's first and only 'pro-witch' government.\" One pamphlet, the 1935 The Christian Witch Craze, claimed that the witch-hunts were an attempt to exterminate \"Aryan womanhood\".\nIn 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds, theorised that the origins of the witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.\nWhile Murray's theory had received some negative critical attention at the time of its first publication, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that her books became best sellers, reaching a larger audience that subsequently experts decided that \"the Murray thesis had to be stopped once and for all\" .\nSimpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the Encyclopaedia Britannica made it accessible to \"journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers\", who adopted it \"enthusiastically\". It influenced the work of Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves.\nInfluence on occultism and contemporary Paganism\nIn the 1950s, several British occultists claimed they had found remnants of the surviving Witch Cult. The first of these was Gerald Gardner, who claimed to have discovered a coven of such witches - the New Forest Coven, in 1939. Gardner said that he was concerned that the religion would die out, and so initiated more members into it through his Bricket Wood coven. The tradition that he started became Gardnerian Wicca. The New Forest witch Sybil Leek made a similar claim, stating that she followed the religion as many of her family had previously done, and a similar claim came from the Australian artist Rosaleen Norton, whose family had been of Welsh origin. Charles Cardell also made the claim of a hereditary lineage of the witch-cult, and he posited that the horned deity of the witches was known as Atho. Other Britons soon made the claim that they were members of a long line of family Witches. Robert Cochrane made such a claim, and ran a coven called the Clan of Tubal Cain; he inspired the founding of several movements, including the 1734 Tradition. Alex Sanders also made such a claim, and founded Alexandrian Wicca; however, Sanders turned out to be a Gardnerian initiate and had based Alexandrian ritual on Gardnerian Wicca. In 1974 E.W. Lidell made the claim that the occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated into the witch-cult in 1899 or 1900, after being introduced to it through Allan Bennett, a Golden Dawn friend of his. Lidell continued his claim by saying that the coven's High Priestess expelled Crowley for being \"a dirty minded, evilly disposed, vicious little monster\". No substantiating evidence has, however, been produced for this.\nCarlo Ginzburg and the benandanti\nFrom the 1960s Carlo Ginzburg documented the beliefs of a number of early modern groups of sorcerers, seers and healers. He claimed they were rooted in pre-Christian paganism, and credited Murray with a \"correct intuition\" in identifying the remnants of a pre-Christian 'religion of Diana', and in believing that witch-trial testimonies did at times represent actual or perceived experiences. In the original Italian preface to I benandanti, published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, claiming that although it contained \"a kernal of truth\", it had been \"formulated in a wholly uncritical way\", containing \"serious defects\". With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his \"Preface to the English Edition\", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that \"Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point.\" He proceeded to accept that although he ultimately rejected her ideas, he reiterated that there was a \"kernel of truth\" in Murray's thesis.\nSome historians have described Ginzburg's ideas as being connected to those of Murray. Hungarian historian Gábor Klaniczay asserted that \"Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about the reality of the witches' Sabbath\" and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 \"reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults\". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade asserted that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti \"does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis\", it did represent a \"well-documented case of the processus through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition.\"\nConversely, other scholars sought to draw a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg. In 1975, Cohn asserted that Ginzburg's discovery had \"nothing to do\" with the theories put forward by Murray. Echoing these views, in 1999 English historian Ronald Hutton asserted that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually \"pretty much the opposite\" of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that \"ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages\" differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events.\nIn the 1970s, with the long-standing criticisms of Murray's thesis by the small number of experts in the field having been ignored by more popular writers, there was a new wave of denunciations by scholars.\n- Michael D.

{"text": "In organic chemistry, a hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which water is added to an unsaturated substrate. Usually, the substrate is an alkene or an alkyne. This type of reaction is employed industrially to produce ethanol, isopropanol, and 2-butanol.\nEpoxides to glycol\n- C2H4O + H2O → HO–CH2CH2–OH\nAcid catalysts are typically used.\nFor the hydration of alkenes, the general chemical equation of the reaction is the following:\n- RRC=CH2 in H2O/acid → RRC(-OH)-CH3\nA hydroxyl group (OH−) attaches to one carbon of the double bond, and a proton (H+) adds to the second carbon center. The reaction is highly exothermic. In the first step, the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the proton, following Markovnikov's rule. In the second step an H2O molecule bonds to the other, more highly substituted carbon. The oxygen atom at this point has three bonds and carries a positive charge (i.e., the molecule is an oxonium). Another water molecule comes along and takes up the extra proton. This reaction tends to yield many undesirable side products, (for example diethyl ether in the process of creating Ethanol) and in its simple form described here is not considered very useful for the production of alcohol.\nTwo approaches are taken. Traditionally the alkene is treated with sulfuric acid to give alkyl sulfate esters. In the case of ethanol production, this step can be written:\n- H2SO4 + C2H4 → C2H5-O-SO3H\nSubsequently this sulfate ester is hydrolyzed to regenerate sulfuric acid and release ethanol:\n- C2H5-O-SO3H + H2O → H2SO4 + C2H5OH\nThis two step route is called the \"indirect process\".\nIn the \"direct process,\" the acid protonates the alkene, and water reacts with this incipient carbocation to give the alcohol. The direct process is more popular because it is simpler. The acid catalysts include phosphoric acid and several solid acids. Here an example reaction mechanism of the hydration of 1-methylcyclohexene to 1-methylcyclohexanol.\nMany alternative routes are available for producing alcohols, including fermentation and hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes.\nHydration of other substrates\nAny unsaturated organic compound is susceptible to hydration. Acetylene hydrates to give acetaldehyde: The process typically relies on mercury catalysts and has been discontinued in the West but still practice in China. The Hg2+ center binds to C≡C triple bond, which is then attacked by water. The reaction is:\n- H2O + C2H2 → CH3CHO\nNitriles undergo hydration to give amides:\n- H2O + RCN → RC(O)NH2\nThis reaction is employed in the production of acrylamide.\nAldehydes and to some extent even ketones, hydrate to for geminal diols. The reaction is especially dominant for formaldehyde, which, in the presence of water, exists significantly as dihydroxymethane.\nConceptually similar reactions include hydroamination and hydroalkoxylation, which involve adding amines and alcohols to alkenes.\nInorganic and materials chemistry\nHydration is an important process in many other applications, perhaps the largest being the production of Portland cement by the crosslinking of calcium oxides and silicates that is induced by water. Hydration of course is the process by which desiccants function.\n- Falbe, Jürgen; Bahrmann, Helmut; Lipps, Wolfgang; Mayer, Dieter (2005), \"Alcohols, Aliphatic\", Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, doi:10.1002/14356007.a01_279.\n- Siegfried Rebsdat; Dieter Mayer (2005), \"Ethylene Glycol\", Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, doi:10.1002/14356007.a10_101"}
{"text": "If it comes to Italian foods, it’s crucial to be aware there are lots of sorts of food which will grace a dining table. Some foods will probably be sexy, though others will be chilly. It’s must be known that irrespective of the sort of food which you attempt, it shouldn’t specify and or invent your view on Italian food for a whole. There are simply too various kinds of food to be enjoyed from the Italian culinary arsenal, and you’d be hard pressed to try out everything it offers in your life.\nFrom Cold Cuts To Baked Ziti\nIt does not matter what it is that you’re enjoying in relation to Italian foods, as everything that you attempt will likely tickle your senses. 1 moment you could be enjoying a fantastic dish of cold cuts this type of soppressata or mortadella, and another you might be enjoying a superb baked ziti. Both have their appeal and values, however both are so opposite from the food spectrum. There’s absolutely no question that you’re likely to enjoy both delightful entries in the intriguing universe of Italian cuisine. Frequently it’s possible to discover lots of items which are both cold and hot which may be combined or discuss space on the Italian supper table in precisely the exact same moment. That is merely a delight for the ones that will dine, since it provides you much in the means of variety and culinary experimentation.\nHot Pasta And Cold Pasta\nItalian foods aren’t temperature particular, and this may be shown to by maybe the hottest of Italian foods in rice. Even though some might presume that pasta is something that’s always served hot, this isn’t the case since there are numerous dishes new that revolve around using pasta that’s been chilled before serving. Fantastic pasta as well as Greek fries are proven to be served at the warmer months from the Mediterranean area, which is a terrific way to dine at the first day on the terrace of a cafe. Cool pasta tastes equally as beautiful as hot pasta, and also the fantastic thing about pasta is if it’s served cold or hot the feel always stays the same. This leaves pasta an perfect food to operate with, and it’s clear why it’s a top pick for many chefs globally now.\nEven Soups Have Variations\nIf it comes to Italian foods which are cold and hot, even soup includes its own differences. Many soups in Italian civilization have been created especially hot or cold depending on the time. Among the most typical and favorite cold sauces in Italy is called gazpacho, which soup includes many different finely chopped veggies. All are blended in a huge pot and simmer for hours; the outcome is a totally amazing flavor and just refreshing feel.

{"text": "Two rare baby tigers have had their first outing in public at Paignton Zoo.\nThe Sumatran cubs, which were born eight weeks ago, have taken their first steps in the sunshine in their viewing enclosure with mum Banda.\nThe infants are being kept separate from their father Tenang as adult males don't have anything to do with rearing.\nThere are only about 350 of the animals left living in the wild and the cubs are the first to be born at the Devon zoo for 20 years.\nThey are an endangered species and most of those in the wild now live in five national parks. There are also between 200 and 300 living in zoos around the world.\nPaignton Zoo's animal expert Neil Bemment said: \"The eyes of tiger cubs open at around three weeks.\n\"They start social play at around five weeks and will be grooming each other at nine weeks and trying solid food by 13 weeks. They should be completely weaned by about week 17.\"\nDespite this, the cubs will still be dependant on their mum until they are 18 months old.\nThe zoo is now looking for names for the cubs and is asking people to email in their suggestions via their website."}
